## How to Setup the Official Stratis Desktop Wallet

Once on the offical Stratis website, click the wallets tab. You will find several options for downloads, but for this tutorial we will use the staking wallet. What I love about this wallet is that you can earn Stratis, just for owning Stratis! Expect around 2% returns for holding your Stratis, this isn't as much as other proof of stake coins such as Ark, Lisk and Neo, but 2% interest is nothing to scoff at. Most Banks offer under 1% interest.
