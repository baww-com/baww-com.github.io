## Best Ripple IOS Wallet

The only IOS wallet that I have tested is the Toast Wallet. The Source Code is available on github, and contains no malicious files. This wallet allows you to send and receieve coins the same way other wallets do, from the comfort of your iPhone.

## Best Ripple Desktop Wallet

The best desktop ripple wallet is either Toast Wallet or Gatehub. I haven't personally used either of these, but have heard great things.

## Best Ripple Android Wallet

The best Ripple Android wallet in my option is also Toast wallet. I haven't tested it on Android as I do not own one, but the IOS version works great! The source code is available on github, and contains no malicious files. This wallet allows you to send and receieve coins the same way other wallets do, from the comfort of your Android

## Should I Use a Web Wallet?

I would not reccomend this, but you could try the [Gatehub wallet](https://www.gatehub.net/).

## Is there a Minimum Deposit for Ripple Wallets?

There is a 20 Ripple minimum deposit for the activation of a new wallet. If you were to send less than 20 ripple to an exchange or other wallet without having stored Ripple into it before, the transaction will not complete. Please note that this is not a a fee or tax, it is just a holding "deposit". As the price of Ripple increases, we may see a decrease in the cost of the deposit.
