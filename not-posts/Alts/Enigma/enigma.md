## How to Buy Enigma with Credit and Debit Card

At the moment, the only way of obtaining Enigma with credit and debit cards is by buying Bitcoin on a fiat to crypto exchange such as Coinbase, and then trading Bitcoin for Enigma on an exchange such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. 

## How to Buy Enigma with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there is currently only one way of buying Enigma with a bank transfer or wire. To do this, exchange your currency for Bitcoin, and then convert you Bitcoin to Enigma on a crypto to cryprto exchane such as Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) {:target="_blank"}.

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Enigma

### Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Don’t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Each of these exchanges have their advantages. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. BitPanda is great for people in Europe and has a 5% fee on credit and debit purchases. If you would like to learn more about [Bitcoin exchanges](/exchanges/), I reccomend checking out our page. In this example, we are going to use Coinbase. If you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will recieve an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into Enigma on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go top the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

### Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/ENG pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Binance Bitcoin adress, which you can find by going to your wallets page on Binance and click the plus sign next to Bitcoin as seen in the second picture. Copy and paste the address into the recipients box on Coinbase. Sending Bitcoin to Binance takes 15-30 minutes usually. If it takes a bit longer don't panic!

![Coinbasehome](/img/Send2.png){: .medium-pic} 
![Coinbasehome](/img/Send3.png){: #biggerpicture}


Depending on the traffic on the Bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour. I know, waiting sucks, but this is still way faster than a bank transfer! 

### Step 3: Buy some Enigma!

After sending your Bitcoin to Binance, you will want to go to the [BTC/ENG trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=ENG_BTC) and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the current orderbook by scrolling down on Binance. Look at the bid section for a good number. After your order is processed, you now own Enigma!

## How to Buy Enigma with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Enigma with paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Binance just like the above example!

## How to Store you Enigma, Securely!

Enigma is a coin that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that it can be stored on [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). 

To start using myEtherWallet, you will need to come up with a secure password. At the minimum, your password should be 9 characters long. After entering a password, press create new wallet. You will be taken to this screen where it asks to download a keystore file.
This keystore file is an encrypted private key, that gives you access to your funds. Please make a backup of this file, by storing another copy of it on a USB or other storage device. If you lose this, it is very difficult to recover your coins.

After clicking "I understand", it will ask you show you your private key, that is un encrypted. You can print a paper wallet through the website if you would like. A paper wallet is a document that contains all the neccesary data to access your cryptocurrency. Usually containing QR Codes and your private keys.


Next, it will ask you how you would like to access your wallet. We just downloaded our encrypted private key, so we will access it using this. Press "Keystore/JSON File", and select the encrypted private key file you just downloaded. Press unlock and we are pretty much done! Your public address will be shown below. This is where you can send your ERC-20 Coins. ERC-20 Coins are any cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain. This includes coins such as EOS, Adex, and Decentraland. 

## Can I Buy Enigma on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} does not sell Enigma. If you are interested in getting Enigma, you can buy Ethereum, Litecoin or Bitcoin on Coinbase, and send it to the cryptocurrency exchange [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. 


## What is the Circulating Supply of Enigma?
