## How to Buy Ripple with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are two methods of buying Ripple with credit and debit cards. The first way, is by converting your currency into Bitcoin using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, and then converting your Bitcoin into Ripple on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. The second method, uses [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} and allows for the purchase of Ripple with USD.


## How to Buy Ripple with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there are two methods of buying Ripple with a bank transfer or wire. Both will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps! The first way, is by buying Bitcoin on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} using your Bank account. After you purchase Bitcoin, you can send it to an exchange that sells Ripple. The cheapest exchange, that sells Ripple is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. All will be explained below with clear pictures and steps!


## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Ripple

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on.

 We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}.

Each of these exchanges have their advantages: 

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} is a very beginner friendly US based exchange, that sells cryptocurrency to most countries and all US states. To see if Coinbase supports your country, [check this link](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1392031-what-countries-are-buys-and-sells-available-in-)!


[Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"} is another option that focuses on credit and debit card purchases. Coinmama is great because they have higher debit and credit card purchasing limits than Coinbase, as well as instant delivery.

Lastly, if you are based in Europe, I would reccomend [Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Bitpanda is an exchange that also focuses on credit and debit card purchases. Their fees are slightly lower, but *only* sells Bitcoin to European countries.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/XRP pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button in your BTC wallet as seen in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You can find this by going to your wallets page on Binance and click the plus sign next to Bitcoin. Copy and paste the address into the recipients box.

## Step 3: Buy some Ripple!

After sending your Bitcoin to Binance, you will want to go to the [BTC/XRP trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=XRP_BTC){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now hold Ripple!

## Method 2 - How to Buy Ripple with Changelly

Step 1: Create an account on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. They have a relatively easy signup process and allow the use of Google, Twitter or Facebook for faster signups.

Step 2: After creating an account, you will want to go to the main page as seen here, and use the conversion box. In this example, we are going to buy Ripple with USD!

## How to Buy Ripple with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Ripple with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Bittrex just like the above example!


## Can I Buy Ripple on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell Ripple. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including Ripple, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying ripple, just follow the steps above!

## How to Store Ripple, Securely!

The best ripple wallet in my opinion is the [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/607d). Read our [Ripple Wallet guide](/wallets/ripple/).
