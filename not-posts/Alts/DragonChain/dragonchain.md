After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/DRGN pairs. For Dragonchain, my favorite exchange is [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=22K26){:target="_blank"}.


 In order to send your Bitcoin from the exchange you bought Bitcoin on, to Kucoin, you will need locate your Bitcoin Kucoin deposit address. This can be found by going on Kucoin, and clicking the $ tab on the right side of the navigation bar. This page will show you all of your cryptocurrency deposit addresses.

### Step 4: How to Store you Dragonchain, Securely!

Congratulations, you now own Dragonchain. Dragonchain is a coin that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that it can be stored on the [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/607d?path=/products/ledger-nano-s&tracker=dc
) as well as [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). 

To start using myEtherWallet, you will need to come up with a secure password. At the minimum, your password should be 9 characters long. After entering a password, press create new wallet. You will be taken to this screen where it asks to download a keystore file. This keystore file is an encrypted private key, that gives you access to your funds. Please make a backup of this file, by storing another copy of it on a USB or other storage device. If you lose this, it is very difficult to recover your coins.

After clicking "I understand", it will ask you show you your private key, that is un encrypted. You can print a paper wallet through the website if you would like. A paper wallet is a document that contains all the neccesary data to access your cryptocurrency. Usually containing QR Codes and your private keys.


Next, it will ask you how you would like to access your wallet. We just downloaded our encrypted private key, so we will access it using this. Press "Keystore/JSON File", and select the encrypted private key file you just downloaded. Press unlock and we are pretty much done! Your public address will be shown below. This is where you can send your ERC-20 Coins. ERC-20 Coins are any cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain. This includes coins such as Dragonchain, Adex, and Decentraland.
