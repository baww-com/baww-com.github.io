## How to Buy DeepBrain Chain with Credit Card and Debit Card

DeepBrain Chain is currently only able to be purchased on [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=22K26){:target="_blank"}. [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=22K26){:target="_blank"} is an exchange limited to cryptocurrency, so in order to get DeepBrain Chain via credit and debit cards, you will need to buy Bitcoin, send it to Kucoin, and then convert it to DeepBrain Chain. If this sounds confusing, I will include a tutorial with pictures below!

## How to Buy DeepBrain Chain with Bank Transfer

Just like with credit and debit cards, the cheapest exchange to obtain DeepBrain Chain on is [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=22K26){:target="_blank"}. In this tutorial, we will buy Bitcoin with a bank transfer, and then send our Bitcoins to Kucoin, where we can buy DeepBrain Chain!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> DeepBrain Chain


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Donâ€™t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on.

 We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}.

Each of these exchanges have their advantages:

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} is a very beginner friendly US based exchange, that sells cryptocurrency to most countries and all US states. To see if Coinbase supports your country, [check this link](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1392031-what-countries-are-buys-and-sells-available-in-)!


[Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"} is another option that focuses on credit and debit card purchases. Coinmama is great because they have higher debit and credit card purchasing limits than Coinbase, as well as instant delivery.

Lastly, if you are based in Europe, I would reccomend [Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Bitpanda is an exchange that also focuses on credit and debit card purchases. Their fees are slightly lower, but *only* sells Bitcoin to European countries.

## How to Buy Bitcoin on Coinbase

In this example, I will show you how to purchase Bitcoins on Coinbase. If you signup to [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} through this link, you will recieve an extra $10 worth of Bitcoin on your first $100+ order.


After creating your Coinbase account, you will want to add a payment method. If you are trying to get the most bang out of your buck, I would reccomend using a bank transfer. If time is a concern, maybe go with credit or debit card, as there is instant delivery! Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab at the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go to the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/DRGN pairs. For DeepBrain Chain, my favorite exchange is [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=22K26){:target="_blank"}.


 In order to send your Bitcoin from the exchange you bought Bitcoin on, to Kucoin, you will need locate your Bitcoin Kucoin deposit address. This can be found by going on Kucoin, and clicking the $ tab on the right side of the navigation bar. This page will show you all of your cryptocurrency deposit addresses. Locate the coin you are depositing, which in this case is Bitcoin.

 Now that we have our deposit address, we will need to send it from Coinbase.
