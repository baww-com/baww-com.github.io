## How to Buy Stellar Lumens with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are two methods of buying Stellar Lumens with credit and debit cards. The first way, is by converting your currency into Bitcoin, and then converting Bitcoin into Stellar Lumens. This exchange can be done on the crypto to crypto exchange [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} The second, using [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} is more instant and direct, but has slightly higher fees.

## How to Buy Stellar Lumens with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there are two methods of buying Stellar Lumens with a bank transfer or wire. Both will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Stellar Lumens

## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you don’t have some already.

There are several exchanges to buy bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Each of these exchanges have their advantages. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly. Coinmama is great for credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. Lastly, BitPanda is great for people in Europe and has a 5% fee on credit and debit purchases. In this example, we are going to use coinbase. Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method.  Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into Stellar Lumens on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/XLM pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) due to its simple interface and good customer support. ![Coinbasehome](/img/Coinbase3.png){: .medium-pic} Depending on the traffic on the bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour.

## Step 3: Buy some Stellar Lumens!

After sending your bitcoin to Binance, you will want to go to the [BTC/XLM trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=XLM_BTC){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now own Stellar Lumens!

## Method 2 - How to Buy Basic Stellar Lumens with Changelly

Step 1: Create an account on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. They have a relatively easy signup process and allow the use of Google, Twitter or Facebook for faster signups.

Step 2: After creating an account, you will want to go to the main page as seen here, and use the conversion box. In this example, we are going to buy Stellar Lumens with USD! 

*At this current time, Changelly has stopped exchanging Lumens. *

## How to Buy Stellar Lumens with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Stellar Lumens with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Binance just like the above example!


## Can I Buy Stellar Lumens on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell Stellar Lumens. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including Stellar Lumens, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying Stellar Lumens, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for Stellar Lumens on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}

## Step 4: How to Store your Stellar Lumens, Securely!

The best two options for storing Stellar Lumens are the Ledger Nano S, and the Offical Stellar Desktop Client. Below, I will show you how to use the Official Desktop Client!

Start off by downloading the correct version for your computer off of the [Stellar Lumen GitHub](https://github.com/stellarchat/desktop-client/releases). This tutorial will demonstrate how to intall and use the Mac OS x version. Other versions should be similar. Once the file is downloaded, open the application. 

I am assuming you do not already have an account, so create a new one! In the event that you do have a Stellar account, import your existing secret key.

![Coinbasehome](/img/stellarstep1.png){: .medium-pic}

After clicking create a new account, you will be prompted to specify a location for your encrypted private key. Put this in a secure location, and create a backup on another device such as a USB. You will be asked for a password, make this secure, but something you will remember. 

![Coinbasehome](/img/stellarpassword.png){: .medium-pic}

We have now set up our Stellar Lumens desktop wallet. If you would like to send or receive, you can do that by pressing the send tab, or giving someone your public wallet address. This can be found by clicking your profile tab.
