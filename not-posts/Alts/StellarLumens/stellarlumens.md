## How to Buy Stellar Lumens with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are two ways to buy Stellar Lumens with a credit or debit card. The first is to convert currency into Bitcoin, then convert Bitcoin into Stellar Lumens. This exchange can be done on the crypto to crypto exchange [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} The second way is to use [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} which is faster but has higher fees to purchase.

NOTE: * Changelly is currently not exchanging Lumens. (January 2018) *


## How to Buy Stellar Lumens with Bank Transfer

There are two ways to buy Stellar Lumens with a bank transfer or wire. See our tutorial below for instructions on each method.

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Stellar Lumens

## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin

There are several exchanges through which you can buy Bitcoin.
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"} are the easiest to use.

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} is a very beginner friendly US based exchange, that sells cryptocurrency to most countries and all US states. To see if Coinbase supports your country, [check this link](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1392031-what-countries-are-buys-and-sells-available-in-)!
[Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"} handles credit or debit card purchases. Coinmama is great because they have higher credit or debit card purchasing limits than Coinbase, as well as fast delivery of your funds.
[Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Bitpanda is an exchange that processes credit or debit card purchases. Their fees are slightly lower, but *ONLY* sells Bitcoin to residents of European Union (EU) countries.
Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit or debit transactions as it has higher purchase limits and quick delivery. BitPanda is great (but it only works in Europe) and has a 5% fee on credit or debit purchases.

We will use Coinbase in this example. Also, if you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will receive an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you donâ€™t have one already and then add your payment method.

After creating your Coinbase account, you need to add a payment method. If you are going for the route with the lowest fees, it is best to use a bank transfer. If timing is more important, use a credit or debit card, as this is much faster!
The Coinbase signup process takes time, but this is to ensure security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum. All of these cryptocurrencies can be converted into Stellar Lumens on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, you are finished with this step! Next will be transferring the Bitcoin to a Stellar Lumens exchange. Also, at this point, we strongly suggest setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) on all exchanges. Two factor authentication  combines two different verification methods to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

Once you have Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/XLM pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) due to its simple interface and good customer support. ![Coinbasehome](/img/Coinbase3.png){: .medium-pic} Depending on the traffic on the bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour.

## Step 3: Buy Stellar Lumens!

After you send bitcoin to Binance, go to the [XLM/BTC trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=XLM_BTC){:target="_blank"} and enter a price  with which you are comfortable. You can look at the order book to get a sense of the current rates. After your order is processed, you will see it in your Stellar Lumens wallet balance in Binance!

## Method 2 - How to Buy Basic Stellar Lumens with Changelly

### Step 1: Create an account on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. They have a relatively easy signup process and allow the use of Google, Twitter or Facebook logins to make the sign-up seamless.

Step 2: Upon creating an account, go to the main page as seen here, and use the conversion box to initiate an exchange. In this example, we are going to buy Stellar Lumens with USD.

* Changelly is currently not exchanging Lumens. (January 2018) *


## How to Buy Stellar Lumens with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Stellar Lumens with Paypal requires one extra step. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have Bitcoin, you can send it to Binance as seen in the example above.


## Can I Buy Stellar Lumens on Coinbase?

Currently, Coinbase does not sell Stellar Lumens. If you want to buy Stellar Lumens, please follow the above steps. You can easily trade Bitcoin for Stellar Lumens on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} to get started!

## Step 4: How to Store your Stellar Lumens

Two popular wallets for Stellar Lumens are:

- Steller Lumens is easily and securely stored on the highly popular hardware wallet [Ledger Nano S!](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/607d)
- Offical Stellar Desktop Client. See tutorial below.

First, download the correct version for your operating system from the official [Stellar Lumen GitHub](https://github.com/stellarchat/desktop-client/releases). (Demonstrating the Mac OS x version, but the experience should be similar regardless of operating system. Download the file and open the application.

Then, create a new account. In the event that you do have a Stellar account, import your existing secret key.

![Coinbasehome](/img/stellarstep1.png){: .medium-pic}

Upon creating your new account, you will be prompted to specify a location to store your encrypted private key. Put the private key in a secure location, and be sure to create a backup on a USB drive or other device. You will be asked for a password - make this password secure, but something you will remember. If you need a open source, secure password manager, check out [KeePass] (https://keepass.info)  

![Coinbasehome](/img/stellarpassword.png){: .medium-pic}

You now have the official Stellar Lumens desktop wallet. If you would like to send or receive XLM, you can do so by clicking the send tab, or having someone send you Stellar Lumens via your public wallet address (which you can find in your profile).
