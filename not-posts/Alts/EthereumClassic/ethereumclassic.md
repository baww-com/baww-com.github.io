## How to buy Ethereum Classic with Credit Card and Debit Card

The easiest way to obtain Ethereum Classic with a credit or debit card is to obtain Bitcoin, and trade BTC/ETC pairs on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}.  Another way to purchase ETC with a credit or debit card is by  using [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} is more instant and direct, but has slightly higher fees. This may sound confusing, but this tutorial will clear up all questions, with text and pictures!

## How to Buy Ethereum Classic with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there are two methods of buying Ethereum Classic with a bank transfer or wire. Both will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Ethereum Classic


### Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you don’t have some already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Coinbase has a very beginner friendly interface, and allows Bitcoin's to be purchased with bank transfers, credit cards and debit cards. Coinmama specializes in credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. BitPanda is *ONLY* for people in Europe and has a 3-4% fee on credit and debit purchases. Read more about each [exchanges](/exchanges/) advantages here. In this example, we are going to use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004). If you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will recieve an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into Ethereum Classic on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

### Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/ETC pairs. I reccomend [Binance](https://launchpad.binance.com/register.html?ref=11566317) or [Bitrex]() due to their simple interfaces and good customer support. Depending on the traffic on the bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour. I know, waiting sucks, but the blockchain is awesome and ensures bitcoins can't be double spended. 

### Step 3: Buy some Ethereum Classic!

After sending your Bitcoin to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, you will want to go to the [BTC/ETC trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=ETC_BTC){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now own Ethereum Classic!

##									Method 2 - Changelly

## How to Buy Ethereum Classic with Changelly

### Step 1: Create an account on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. They have a relatively easy signup process and allow the use of Google, Twitter or Facebook for faster signups.

### Step 2: After creating an account, you will want to go to the main page as seen here, and use the conversion box. In this example, we are going to buy Ethereum Classic with USD!

## How to Buy Ethereum Classic with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Ethereum Classic with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Binance just like the above example!

## Can I Buy Ethereum Classic on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell Ethereum Classic. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including Ethereum Classic, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying Ethereum Classic, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for Ethereum Classic on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}

## How do I Mine Ethereum Classic?

In order to mine most cryptocurrencies, you will need a powerful graphics card and power supply. I reccomend using the [Radeon RX 480](http://amzn.to/2fz5rEL){:target="_blank"}. Ethereum Classic is one of the most PROFITABLE Cryptocurrencies to mine.

## How to Store you Ethereum Classic, Securely!

 If you are looking for a hardware wallet, I would reccomend [Trezor](https://shop.trezor.io?a=cryptoking.io){:target="_blank"}. Otherwise, [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com){:target="_blank"} works great!
