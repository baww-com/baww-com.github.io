## How to Buy Monero with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are two methods of buying Monero with credit and debit cards. The first way, is by converting your currency into Bitcoin, and then converting Bitcoin into Monero. This can be done on the exchange [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. The second, using [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} is more instant and direct, but has slightly higher fees.

## How to Buy Monero with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there are two methods of buying Monero with a bank transfer or wire. Both will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Monero

## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Don’t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Each of these exchanges have their advantages. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery.  BitPanda is great for people in Europe and has a 3-4% fee on credit and debit purchases. In this example, we are going to use coinbase. Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method.  Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into Monero on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use bitcoin.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/XMR pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button in your BTC wallet as seen in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You can find this by going to your wallets page on Binance and click the plus sign next to Bitcoin. Copy and paste the address into the recipients box.

## Step 3: Buy some Monero!

After sending your bitcoin to Binance, you will want to go to the [BTC/XMR trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=XMR_BTC){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now hold Monero!

## Method 2 - How to Buy Monero with Changelly

Step 1: Create an account on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. They have a relatively easy signup process and allow the use of Google, Twitter or Facebook for faster signups.

Step 2: After creating an account, you will want to go to the main page as seen here, and use the conversion box. In this example, we are going to buy Monero with USD!

## How to Buy Monero with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Monero with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} just like the above example!

## Can I Buy Monero on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell Monero. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including Monero, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying Monero, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for Monero on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}.

## Why is Monero considered a Privacy Coin?

Monero makes privacy mandatory by using a ring system and stealth adresses. [Ring signatures](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/ringsignatures.html) are a type of digital signature that can be executed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. It is impossible to narrow down a transaction to an individual because of this system. [Stealth adresses](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/stealthaddress.html) are one time use adresses, created on demand. Stealth adresses make it so that *only* the sender and receiver know who was involved in a transaction.
