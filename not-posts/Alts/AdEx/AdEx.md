## How to Buy AdEx with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are two methods of buying AdEx with credit and debit cards. The first way, is by converting your currency into Bitcoin, and then converting Bitcoin into AdEx on an exchange such as[Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911). The second, using [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} is more instant and direct, and allows you to control the private keys for your coins.


## How to Buy AdEx with a Bank or Wire Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there are two methods of buying AdEx with a bank transfer or wire. Adex is currently limited to cryptocurrency exchanges, and is traded on BTC pairs. In order to obtain it with a bank transfer, we will send Bitcoin that we bought via bank transfer to a cryptocurrency exchange where Adex is sold.

 The other method, involves the popular shapeshifting website [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. Both methods will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps! 

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> AdEx


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Donâ€™t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges that you can buy Bitcoin on.

 We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}.

Each of these exchanges have their advantages: 

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} is a very beginner friendly US based exchange, that sells cryptocurrency to most countries and all US states. To see if Coinbase supports your country, [check this link](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1392031-what-countries-are-buys-and-sells-available-in-)!


[Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"} is another option that focuses on credit and debit card purchases. Coinmama is great because they have higher debit and credit card purchasing limits than Coinbase, as well as instant delivery.

The last option is [Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Bitpanda is an exchange that also focuses on credit and debit card purchases. Their fees are slightly lower, but *only* sells Bitcoin to European countries.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go top the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/ADX pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://launchpad.binance.com/register.html?ref=11566317){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Binance Bitcoin adress, which you can find by going to the Funds tab on the Binance navigation bar and then clicking "Deposits Withdrawls". Once on this screen, you will see a list of coins. Scroll down to Bitcoin, and hit the plus sign. This is the address you will copy and paste into Coinbase. Click send on Coinbase, and wait 15-30 minutes for your BTC to arrive.

Depending on the traffic on the Bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour. I know, waiting sucks, but this still way faster than a bank! 


## Step 3: Buy some AdEx!

After sending your bitcoin to Binance, you will want to go to the [BTC/ADX trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=ADX_BTC){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now hold AdEx!

## How to Buy AdEx with Changelly

Step 1: Create an account on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. They have a relatively easy signup process and allow the use of Google, Twitter or Facebook for faster signups.

Step 2: After creating an account, you will want to go to the main page as seen here, and use the conversion box. In this example, we are going to buy AdEx with USD!

## How to Buy AdEx with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying AdEx with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Bittrex just like the above example!


## Can I Buy Adex on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell Adex. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including Adex, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying Adex, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for Adex on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}

## Step 4: How to Store you AdEx, Securely!

Adex is a coin that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that it can be stored on [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). 

To start using myEtherWallet, you will need to come up with a secure password. At the minimum, your password should be 9 characters long. After entering a password, press create new wallet. You will be taken to this screen where it asks to download a keystore file.
This keystore file is an encrypted private key, that gives you access to your funds. Please make a backup of this file, by storing another copy of it on a USB or other storage device. If you lose this, it is very difficult to recover your coins. 

![BuyAdex](/img/ethpass.png){: .medium-pic}
![BuyAdex](/img/keystore.png){: .medium-pic}

After clicking "I understand", it will ask you show you your private key, that is un encrypted. You can print a paper wallet through the website if you would like. A paper wallet is a document that contains all the neccesary data to access your cryptocurrency. Usually containing QR Codes and your private keys.


Next, it will ask you how you would like to access your wallet. We just downloaded our encrypted private key, so we will access it using this. Press "Keystore/JSON File", and select the encrypted private key file you just downloaded. Press unlock and we are pretty much done! Your public address will be shown below. This is where you can send your ERC-20 Coins. ERC-20 Coins are any cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain. This includes coins such as Walton, Adex, and Decentraland. 

## What is the Circulating Supply of Adex?

At the time of this writing, there is a circulating supply of 60,248,315 ADX. This will eventually reach the cap of 100,000,000 ADX.
