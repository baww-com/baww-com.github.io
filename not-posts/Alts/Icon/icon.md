## How to Buy Icon with Credit Card and Debit Card

Icon is currently only able to be purchased on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} is an exchange limited to cryptocurrency, so in order to get Icon via credit and debit cards, you will need to buy Bitcoin, send it to Binance, and then convert it to Icon. If this sounds confusing, I will include a tutorial with pictures below!


## How to Buy Icon with Bank Transfer

Just like with credit and debit cards, the cheapest exchange to obtain Icon on is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. In this tutorial, we will buy Bitcoin with a bank transfer, and then send our Bitcoins to Binance, where we can buy Icon!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Icon


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Donâ€™t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on.

 We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}.

Each of these exchanges have their advantages: 

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} is a very beginner friendly US based exchange, that sells cryptocurrency to most countries and all US states. To see if Coinbase supports your country, [check this link](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1392031-what-countries-are-buys-and-sells-available-in-)!


[Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"} is another option that focuses on credit and debit card purchases. Coinmama is great because they have higher debit and credit card purchasing limits than Coinbase, as well as instant delivery.

Lastly, if you are based in Europe, I would reccomend [Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Bitpanda is an exchange that also focuses on credit and debit card purchases. Their fees are slightly lower, but *only* sells Bitcoin to European countries.

## How to Buy Bitcoin on Coinbase

In this example, I will show you how to purchase Bitcoins on Coinbase. If you signup to [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} through this link, you will recieve an extra $10 worth of Bitcoin on your first $100+ order.


After creating your Coinbase account, you will want to add a payment method. If you are trying to get the most bang out of your buck, I would reccomend using a bank transfer. If time is a concern, maybe go with credit or debit card, as there is instant delivery! Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab at the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go to the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/ICX pairs. For Icon, my favorite exchange is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}.


 Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Binance Bitcoin adress, which you can find by going to the Funds tab on the Binance navigation bar and then clicking "Deposits Withdrawls". Once on this screen, you will see a list of coins. Scroll down to Bitcoin, and hit the plus sign. This is the address you will copy and paste into Coinbase. Click send on Coinbase, and wait 15-30 minutes for your BTC to arrive.

## Step 3: Buy some Icon!

After your Bitcoin arrives, you will have a Bitcoin balance to purchase Icon with. Go to the [ICX/BTC page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=ICX_BTC)

## How to Buy Icon with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Icon with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) just like the above example!


## Can I Buy Icon on Coinbase?

Icon is currently only sold on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but it is possible it could be added along with several new coins in 2018.



## Step 4: How to Store you Icon, Securely!

Icon is a coin that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that it can be stored on [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). 

To start using myEtherWallet, you will need to come up with a secure password. At the minimum, your password should be 9 characters long. After entering a password, press create new wallet. You will be taken to this screen where it asks to download a keystore file. This keystore file is an encrypted private key, that gives you access to your funds. Please make a backup of this file, by storing another copy of it on a USB or other storage device. If you lose this, it is very difficult to recover your coins. 

![IconChain](/img/ethpass.png){: .medium-pic}
![Iconchain](/img/keystore.png){: .medium-pic}

After clicking "I understand", it will ask you show you your private key, that is un encrypted. You can print a paper wallet through the website if you would like. A paper wallet is a document that contains all the neccesary data to access your cryptocurrency. Usually containing QR Codes and your private keys.


Next, it will ask you how you would like to access your wallet. We just downloaded our encrypted private key, so we will access it using this. Press "Keystore/JSON File", and select the encrypted private key file you just downloaded. Press unlock and we are pretty much done! Your public address will be shown below. This is where you can send your ERC-20 Coins. ERC-20 Coins are any cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain. This includes coins such as Icon, Adex, and Dragonchain. 

## What is the Circulating Supply of Icon?

At the time of this writing, there is a circulating supply of 238,421,940 Icon. This will eventually reach the cap of 433,494,437 Icon.
