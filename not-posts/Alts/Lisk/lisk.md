## How to Buy Lisk with Credit and Debit Cards

There are two ways of buying Lisk with credit and debit cards. The first way, is by converting your currency into Bitcoin, and then converting Bitcoin into Lisk. This can be done on the exhchange [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911). The second, uses [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} and is more instant and direct, but has slightly higher fees.

## How to Buy Lisk with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there are two methods of buying Lisk with a bank transfer or wire. Both will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps!


## 									Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Lisk

## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Don’t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Coinbase has a very beginner friendly interface, and allows Bitcoin's to be purchased with bank transfers, credit cards and debit cards. Coinmama specializes in credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. BitPanda is *ONLY* for people in Europe and has a 3-4% fee on credit and debit purchases. Read more about each [exchanges](/exchanges/) advantages here. In this example, we are going to use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004). If you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will recieve an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into Lisk on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/ADX pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Binance Bitcoin adress, which you can find by going to the Funds tab on the Binance navigation bar and then clicking "Deposits Withdrawls". Once on this screen, you will see a list of coins. Scroll down to Bitcoin, and hit the plus sign. This is the address you will copy and paste into Coinbase. Click send on Coinbase, and wait 15-30 minutes for your BTC to arrive.

## Step 3: Buy some Lisk!

After sending your bitcoin to Bittrex, you will want to go to the [BTC/Lisk trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=LSK_BTC){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now hold Lisk!

## Method 2 - Changelly

## How to Buy Lisk with Changelly

### Step 1: Create an account on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. They have a relatively easy signup process and allow the use of Google, Twitter or Facebook for faster signups.

### Step 2: After creating an account, you will want to go to the main page as seen here, and use the conversion box. In this example, we are going to buy Lisk with USD!

## How to Buy Lisk with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Lisk with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Bittrex just like the above example!



## Can I Buy Lisk on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell Lisk. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including Lisk, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying Lisk, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for Lisk on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}


## Step 4: How to Store you Lisk, Securely!

For Lisk, I reccomend the [offical Lisk Wallet](https://lisk.io/download){:target="_blank"}. Below will be a tutorial on how to use the wallet!

Start off by downloading the correct wallet for your operating system. This guide will show how to install the wallet on Mac.

Drag the wallet into your applications, and launch it. Create a new account if you do not already have one. After clicking create, you will be asked to move your mouse randomly, to generate a private key and pass phrase. Save your passphrase somewhere safe, and create a backup on a USB or other storage device.

After clicking "Yes it's safe" you will be asked to enter the missing word. This is to prove that you saved it responsibly. The Lisk Wallet interface is very clear. There are send and receieve tabs, and a section for voting. If you plan on storing Lisk for the long term, I highly reccomend voting. Voting allows you to forge and receive FREE Lisk. Read more about [Lisk forging here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lisk/comments/6wsb9x/voting_explained/){:target="_blank"}.


## What is the Total Supply of Lisk?

There are currently 116,260,112 LSK.
