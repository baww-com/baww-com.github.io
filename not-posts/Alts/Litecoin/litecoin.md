It is very easy to buy Litecoin with a credit or debit card on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}. Alternatively, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"} is great too. This tutorial will show how to buy with Coinbase. After adding your credit or debit card info, click the Buy/Sell tab and choose Litecoin. Enter the amount you wish to buy, and that's it! Litecoin should appear in your Coinbase wallet very quickly.

## Buy Litecoin with Bank Account

Though it takes longer to complete a bank transfer, using a [bank account or bank transfer](/buy-bitcoin/bank/) will allow you to buy larger amounts of Litecoin. Follow the same steps as above, but add your bank as a payment method in [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}.

## How to Buy Litecoin with PayPal
