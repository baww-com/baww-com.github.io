## How to Buy Zencash with Credit Card 

At the moment, the best way of obtaining Zencash with credit cards is by buying Bitcoin, and then trading Bitcoin for Zencash on an exchange. 

## How to Buy Zencash with Debit Card

At the moment, the best way of obtaining Zencash with debit cards is by buying Bitcoin, and then trading Bitcoin for Zencash on an exchange. 

## How to Buy Zencash with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there is currently only one way of buying Zencash with a bank transfer or wire. It will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Zencash

### Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Don’t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Each of these exchanges have their advantages. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. BitPanda is great for those of you in Europe and it has a 5% fee on credit and debit purchases. If you would like to learn more about [Bitcoin exchanges](/exchanges/), I reccomend checking out our page. In this example, we are going to use Coinbase. If you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will recieve an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into Zencash on exchanges such as [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/), but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go top the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

### Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/ZEN pairs. My favorite is [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Bittrex Bitcoin adress, which you can find by going to your wallets page on Bittrex and click the plus sign next to Bitcoin as seen in the second picture. Copy and paste the address into the recipients box on Coinbase. Sending Bitcoin to Bittrex takes 15-30 minutes usually. If it takes a bit longer don't panic!

Depending on the traffic on the Bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour. I know, waiting sucks, but this is still way faster than a bank transfer! 

### Step 3: Buy some Zencash!

After sending your Bitcoin to Bittrex, you will want to go to the [BTC/ZEN trading page](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-ZEN) and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the current orderbook by scrolling down on Bittrex. Look at the bid section for a good number. After your order is processed, you now hold Zencash!

## How to Buy Zencash with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Zencash with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Bittrex just like the above example!
