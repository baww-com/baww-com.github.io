Ripple has seen its price rise from less than .20 cents to over 1.20 in the span of weeks. While there is a large ciculating supply of over 38 Billion, a similar price increase happening in the next months is not out of the question. 

If you are interested in buying Ripple, and are based in the USA, start off by creating an account on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}.
Coinbase is by far the most popular exchange to Buy cryptocurrency on. At the time of this writing, Ripple is not available on Coinbase, so we will have to take a few extra steps to get Ripple. Exchanges, such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911), allow you to convert Bitcoin into Ripple(XRP) fast and easy. 


## Step 1: Make a Coinbase Account

Create an account on Coinbase. They may ask for you to link your phone number or email, or send a picture of your ID for verification purchases. After these are verified, we will need to add a payment method. I highly reccomend using a bank transfer, as this method allows high limits and low fees. If you want to recieve your Bitcoin instantly, then a credit or debit card will do.


## Step 2: Send your Bitcoin from Coinbase to Binance

After you have recieved your Bitcoin, you will need to send it to the exchange [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, where they have a Ripple/Bitcoin market. To do this, go to you Coinbase Bitcoin wallet tab, and click send. You will be asked to enter a deposit address. You can find this address on your Binance account. On Binance, click the "Funds" tab on the navigation bar, and press "Deposits Withdrawls", scroll down or search Bitcoin to locate your Bitcoin Wallet. Press deposit, and copy and paste the address into Coinbase. Click send and wait for your Bitcoin to arrive.

## Step 3: Buy Ripple

Now that we have a Bitcoin balance on Binance, we can convert it to Ripple. You can do this by going to the main page of Binance and searching XRP. You are now on the [XRP/BTC trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=XRP_BTC){:target="_blank"}.

Go to the Buy XRP section and enter the number of bits you are comfortable buying each Ripple at. Use the market order book on the left side of the page to get a good idea for the price. In this screenshot, a fair price would be between 7090-7110 Satoshis. Press the "100%" button when you have entered your price and click Buy XRP. Depending on the price you chose, the order should execute quickly.
