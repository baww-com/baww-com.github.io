## How to Buy Siacoin with Credit Card and Debit Card

The best way to obtain Siacoin with credit and debit cards is by buying Bitcoin with your credit or debit card using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, and then trading your Bitcoin for Siacoin on an exchange such as [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Home/Markets){:target="_blank"}.

## How to Buy Siacoin with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, the best methods of buying Siacoin with a bank transfer or wire is by buying Bitcoin on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004), and then transfering it to Bittrex to buy Siacoin. All will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Siacoin


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Don’t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Each of these exchanges have their advantages. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. BitPanda is great for people in Europe and has a 3-4% fee on credit and debit purchases. In this example, we are going to use coinbase. If you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will recieve an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into Siacoin on exchanges such as [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Home/Markets){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go top the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

### Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/GRS pairs. My favorite is [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Home/Markets){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Bittrex Bitcoin adress, which you can find  by going to your wallets page on Bittrex and click the plus sign next to Bitcoin as seen in the second picture. Copy and paste the address into the recipients box on Coinbase.

Depending on the traffic on the Bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour. I know, waiting sucks, but this still way faster than a bank! 


## Step 3: Buy some Siacoin!

After sending your bitcoin to Bittrex, you will want to go to the [BTC/GRS trading page](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-GRS){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now hold Siacoin!

## How to Buy Siacoin with Changelly

Step 1: Create an account on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. They have a relatively easy signup process and allow the use of Google, Twitter or Facebook for faster signups.

Step 2: After creating an account, you will want to go to the main page as seen here, and use the conversion box. In this example, we are going to buy Siacoin with USD!

## How to Buy Siacoin with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Siacoin with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Bittrex just like the above example!


## Step 4: How to Store you Siacoin, Securely!
