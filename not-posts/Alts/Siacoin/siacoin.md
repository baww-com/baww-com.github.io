## How to Buy Siacoin with Credit Card and Debit Card

The best way to obtain Siacoin with a credit or debit card is to buy Bitcoin with your credit or debit card using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, then trading Bitcoin for Siacoin on an exchange like [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Home/Markets){:target="_blank"}.

## How to Buy Siacoin with Bank Transfer

The best way to buy Siacoin with a bank transfer or wire is to buy Bitcoin on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004), then send it to Bittrex to buy Siacoin. Please see below for a detailed explanation.

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Siacoin


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin
There are several exchanges through which you can buy Bitcoin.

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"} are the easiest to use.

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} is a very beginner friendly US based exchange, that sells cryptocurrency to most countries and all US states. To see if Coinbase supports your country, [check this link](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1392031-what-countries-are-buys-and-sells-available-in-)!
[Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"} handles credit or debit card purchases. Coinmama is great because they have higher credit or debit card purchasing limits than Coinbase, as well as fast delivery of your funds.
[Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Bitpanda is an exchange that processes credit or debit card purchases. Their fees are slightly lower, but *ONLY* sells Bitcoin to residents of European Union (EU) countries.

Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit or debit transactions as it has higher purchase limits and quick delivery. BitPanda is great (but it only works in Europe) and has a 5% fee on credit or debit purchases.

We will use Coinbase in this example. Also, if you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will receive an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you donâ€™t have one already and then add your payment method.

After creating your Coinbase account, you need to add a payment method. If you are going for the route with the lowest fees, it is best to use a bank transfer. If timing is more important, use a credit or debit card, as this is much faster!
The Coinbase signup process takes time, but this is to ensure security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum. All of these cryptocurrencies can be converted into 00000000000 on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

 After hitting Confirm Buy, you are finished with this step! Next will be transferring the Bitcoin to a 000000 exchange. Also, at this point, we strongly suggest setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different verification methods to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

### Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

Once you have Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/GRS pairs. [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Home/Markets){:target="_blank"} is a popular choice among crypto traders as it has an intuitive interface and responsive customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. Next, you will be asked to enter the recipient's wallet address. Enter your Bittrex Bitcoin address here, which you can find by going to the "Wallets" page on Bittrex and clicking the plus + sign next to "Bitcoin" as seen in the second picture below. Copy and paste the address into the recipient's box on Coinbase.

Depending on the traffic on the Bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer. This can be stressful but do not worry!


## Step 3: Buy Siacoin

After sending your bitcoin to Bittrex, you will want to go to the [BTC/GRS trading page](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-GRS){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. Once your order goes through, you will see it in your Siacoin wallet on Bittrex!
