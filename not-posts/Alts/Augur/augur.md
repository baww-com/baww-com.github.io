## How to Buy Augur with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are currently two methods of buying Augur with a credit or debit card. The first, is by converting your currency into Bitcoin, and then converting Bitcoin into Augur. The second way is to use [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} which is faster but has higher fees to purchase.

## How to Buy Augur with Bank Transfer

There are two ways to buy Augur with a bank transfer or wire. Both methods are explained below.

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Augur


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin

There are several exchanges through which you can buy Bitcoin. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"} are the easiest to use.

Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit or debit transactions as it has higher purchase limits and quick delivery. BitPanda is great (but it only works in Europe) and has a 5% fee on credit or debit purchases. We will use Coinbase in this example. Also, if you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will receive an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you donâ€™t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum. All of these cryptocurrencies can be converted into 0x on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, you are finished with this step! Next will be transferring the Bitcoin to an Augur exchange. Also, at this point, we strongly suggest setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) on all exchanges. Two factor authentication  combines two different verification methods to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

Once you have Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/REP pairs.
[Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Home/Markets){:target="_blank"} is popular thanks to a zippy interface and great customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipient's wallet address. Enter your Bittrex Bitcoin address, which you can find by going to your wallets page on Bittrex, then clicking the plus + sign next to Bitcoin as seen in the second picture. Copy the bitcoin address and paste it into the recipient address box on Coinbase.

## Step 3: Buy Augur

After your Bitcoin arrives, you will have a balance with which to purchase Augur. Go to the [REP/BTC page](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-REP) and you will see a box that says Buy Augur. Enter a ratio with which you are comfortable. You can look at the order book to get a sense of the current rates. After your order is processed, you will see it in your Augur wallet balance.

## Can I Buy Augur on Coinbase?

Currently, Coinbase does not sell Augur. The best way is to buy bitcoin on Coinbase and transfer to Bittrex as noted above. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} to get started!

## How to Buy Augur with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Augur with Paypal requires one extra step. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have Bitcoin, you can send it to [Bittrex](https://www.bittrex.com) as seen in the example above.
