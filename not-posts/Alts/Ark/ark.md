## How to Buy Ark with Credit and Debit Card

Ark is not currently listed on a fiat to crypto exchange. This means that in order to obtain it, we will need to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum using a debit and credit card, and then send it to a crypto to crypto exchange. such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}



## How to Buy Ark with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, the best way to obtain Ark with a bank transfer, is by purchasing Bitcoin or Ethereum from a fiat to crypto exchange such as Coinbase, and then sending the purchased cryptocurrency to Binance, where Ark is sold. 

This process will be explained below with clear pictures and steps.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go top the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

### Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/ARK pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Binance Bitcoin adress, which you can find by going to your wallets page on Binance and click the plus sign next to Bitcoin as seen in the second picture. Copy and paste the address into the recipients box on Coinbase. Sending Bitcoin to Binance takes 15-30 minutes usually. If it takes a bit longer don't panic!

Depending on the traffic on the Bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour. I know, waiting sucks, but this is still way faster than a bank transfer! 

### Step 3: Buy some ARK!

After sending your Bitcoin to Binance, you will want to go to the [BTC/ARK trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=ARK_BTC) and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the current orderbook by scrolling down on Binance. Look at the bid section for a good number. After your order is processed, you now hold ARK!

## How to Buy Ark with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Ark with paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Binance just like the above example!

## How to Store you ARK, Securely!

 After using one of these two methods, you now hold ARK. We are going to teach you how to get it off the exchange, and into your wallet below. When storing cryptocurrencies, hardware wallets are the most secure. You can find some hardware wallets to buy [here](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/607d). A free alternative is the [Official ARK Wallet](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-desktop) . Both of these options have their benefits. The Ledger Nano S, is the more secure offline storage. However, the offical ARK wallet is free. Both allow staking, which allows you to earn free ARK, just for owning it! Learn more about it below.

 If you used Binance, you will wallets tab, and click the "-", to withdraw from the exchange. 

## Can I Buy Ark on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell Ark. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including Ark, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying Ark, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for Ark on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}

## How to get FREE Ark

Unlike most cryptocurrencies, ARK has no mining system. They have a forging system. In this system, you vote for a delegate, with only 51 of them being active. These delegates confirm transactions to help and are rewarded 2 ARK per block, plus other fees. These fees include transaction fees, voting fees, delegate registraion fees and lastly 2nd Passphrase registration fees. At the time of this writing, transactions fees are .1 ARK, delegate registraion is 25 ARK, 2nd Passphrase registration is 5 ARK, and voting and unvoting fees are 1 ARK. The ARK team plans to lower these in the future. When voting for a delegate, your vote is worth a proportional amount to the ark you hold. The more ark you stake with, the more you receive from your delegate! I choose to stake with Jarunik as he has good rewards, and is active in the [ARK  Reddit Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArkEcosystem/){:target="_blank"}. If you would like to calculate how much ARK you would earn from staking, try this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FGo3FkC3uSWXGHatPQyny2brMWjAIJsHFCR-Lhkl_m0/edit#gid=0){:target="_blank"}. Enter your amount of ark in the top box and it will show an estimate return for each delegate. There are other benefits such as payout so make sure to choose carefully.

## Does Ark support Atomic swaps?

Ark does not have atomic swaps, however, one of Arks defining features are smartbridges. Smartbridges allow blockchains from other cryptocurrencies to interact with eachother. In order for another cryptocurrency to connect via smart bridges, a few lines of code must be added to that currencies code. This article on the [ARK Blog](https://blog.ark.io/smartbridge-technology-by-ark-ab3e97a081db){:target="_blank"} gives more details about this feature.
