## How to Buy Ark with Credit and Debit Card

Ark is not currently listed on a fiat to crypto exchange. This means that in order to obtain it, you will need to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum using a debit and credit card, and then send it to a crypto to crypto exchange like [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}



## How to Buy Ark with Bank Transfer

The best way to obtain Ark with a bank transfer, is by purchasing Bitcoin or Ethereum from a fiat to crypto exchange such as Coinbase, then sending the purchased cryptocurrency to Binance, where Ark is sold.

After hitting Confirm Buy, you are finished with this step! Next will be transferring the Bitcoin to an Ark exchange. Also, at this point, we strongly suggest setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) on all exchanges. Two factor authentication  combines two different verification methods to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

### Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

Once you have Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/ARK pairs.

[Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} is hugely popular due to its intuitive interface and solid customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipient's wallet address. Enter your Binance Bitcoin address, which you can find by going to the "Funds" tab on the Binance navigation bar, then clicking "Deposits Withdrawals". Once on this screen, you will see a list of coins. Scroll down to Bitcoin, and hit the "Deposit" button. Copy the address that appears and paste into Coinbase. Click send on Coinbase, and wait about 30 minutes for your BTC to arrive.

Depending on the traffic on the Bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer. This can be stressful but do not worry!

### Step 3: Buy ARK

After you send bitcoin to Binance, go to the [BTC/ARK trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=ARK_BTC) and enter a ratio with which you are comfortable. You can look at the current order book by scrolling down on Binance. Look at the bid section for a good number. After your order is processed, you will see ARK in your Funds page on Binance.

## How to Buy Ark with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Ark with paypal requires one extra step. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have Bitcoin, you can send it to Binance as seen in the example above.

## How to securely store ARK 

 After using one of these two methods, you now hold ARK. We are going to teach you how to get it off the exchange, and into your wallet below. When storing cryptocurrencies, hardware wallets are the most secure. You can find some hardware wallets to buy [here](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/607d). A free alternative is the [Official ARK Wallet](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-desktop). The Ledger Nano S is more secure offline storage. If you are cost-conscious, the official ARK wallet is free. Both allow staking, which allows you to earn free ARK, just for owning it! Learn more about it below.

 If you used Binance, head to the Deposits Withdrawals tab, locate ARK and click the "Withdraw" button to withdraw ARK from the exchange.

## How to get FREE Ark

Unlike most cryptocurrencies, ARK has no mining system. Instead, they have a forging system. In this system, you vote for a delegate, with only 51 of them being active. These delegates confirm transactions and are rewarded 2 ARK per block, plus other fees, including transaction fees, voting fees, delegate registration fees and "2nd Passphrase" registration fees. At the time of this writing, transactions fees are .1 ARK, delegate registration is 25 ARK, 2nd Passphrase registration is 5 ARK, and voting and unvoting fees are 1 ARK. The ARK team plans to lower these fees in the future. When voting for a delegate, your vote is worth a proportional amount to the ark you hold. The more ark you stake with, the more you receive from your delegate. Check out the [ARK  Reddit Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArkEcosystem/){:target="_blank"} for more information. If you would like to calculate how much ARK you would earn from staking, try this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FGo3FkC3uSWXGHatPQyny2brMWjAIJsHFCR-Lhkl_m0/edit#gid=0){:target="_blank"}. Enter your amount of Ark in the top box and it will show an estimated return for each delegate. There are other benefits - such as payout - so make sure to choose carefully.

## Does Ark support Atomic swaps?

Ark does not have atomic swaps, however, one of Arks defining features are smartbridges. Smartbridges allow blockchains from other cryptocurrencies to interact with each other, which is in very high demand as the cryptocurrency space continues to grow. In order for another cryptocurrency to connect via smartbridges, a few lines of code must be added to that currencies code. This article on the [ARK Blog](https://blog.ark.io/smartbridge-technology-by-ark-ab3e97a081db){:target="_blank"} gives more details about this feature.
