## How to Buy Neo with Credit Card and Debit Card

The easiest and cheapest way to get Neo with a debit or credit card, is to buy bitcoin with your credit or debit card, and then send it to an exchange that sells Neo. The exchange with the lowest fees, that sells Neo is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}.

## How to Buy Neo with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, the best way obtaining Neo with a Bank Transfer is to buy Bitcoin on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, and then send it to an exchange that sells Neo. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} is the cheapest exchange that sells Neo. All will be explained below, with pictures.

## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Don’t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Each of these exchanges have their advantages. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery.  BitPanda is great for people in Europe and has a 5% fee on credit and debit purchases. In this example, we are going to use coinbase. Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method.  Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into Neo on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/NEO pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button in your BTC wallet as seen in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You can find this by going to your wallets page on Binance and click the plus sign next to Bitcoin. Copy and paste the address into the recipients box.

## Step 3: Buy some Neo!

After sending your Bitcoin to Binance, you will want to go to the [BTC/NEO trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=NEO_BTC){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now hold Neo!

## How to Buy Neo on Changelly

At the time of this writing, Neo is not sold on Changelly. If you are interested in getting Neo, I would try [Binance](https://launchpad.binance.com/register.html?ref=11566317){:target="_blank"}! It has much lower fees than Changelly! 



## Can I Buy Neo on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell Neo. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including Neo, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying Neo, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for Neo on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}

## How to Buy Neo with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Neo with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Binance just like the above example!
