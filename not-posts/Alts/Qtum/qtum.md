## How to Buy Qtum with Credit Card and Debit Card

The best method of buying Qtum with credit and debit cards is by converting your currency into Bitcoin using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, and then converting your Bitcoin into Qtum on an exchange that sells Qtum. The cheapest exchange to buy Qtum on is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}.

## How to Buy Qtum with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, the best method of buying Qtum with a bank transfer is by converting your currency into Bitcoin on Coinbase, and then converting Bitcoin into Qtum on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. All will be explained below with clear pictures and steps.


## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Qtum


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Don’t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Coinbase has a very beginner friendly interface, and allows Bitcoin's to be purchased with bank transfers, credit cards and debit cards. Coinmama specializes in credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. BitPanda is *ONLY* for people in Europe and has a 5% fee on credit and debit purchases. Read more about each [exchanges](/exchanges/) advantages here. In this example, we are going to use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004). If you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will recieve an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into Qtum on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go top the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/QTUM pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Binance Bitcoin adress, which you can find by going to the Funds tab on the Binance navigation bar and then clicking "Deposits Withdrawls". Once on this screen, you will see a list of coins. Scroll down to Bitcoin, and hit the plus sign. This is the address you will copy and paste into Coinbase. Click send on Coinbase, and wait 15-30 minutes for your BTC to arrive.

Depending on the traffic on the Bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour. I know, waiting sucks, but this still way faster than a bank! 


## Step 3: Buy some Qtum!

After sending your bitcoin to Binance, you will want to go to the [BTC/QTUM trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=QTUM_BTC){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now hold Qtum!

## Can I Buy Qtum on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell Qtum. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including Qtum, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying Qtum, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for Qtum on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}.

## How to Buy Qtum with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Qtum with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Bittrex just like the above example!


## Step 4: How to Store you Qtum, Securely!
