## How to Buy Monaco with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are two methods of buying Monaco with credit and debit cards. The first way, is by converting your currency into Bitcoin, and then converting Bitcoin into Monaco on an exchange called [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911).The second method uses [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} and is more instant and direct, but has slightly higher fees.

## How to Buy Monaco with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there are two methods of buying Monaco with a bank transfer or wire. Both will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Monaco

## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you don’t have some already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Coinbase has a very beginner friendly interface, and allows Bitcoin's to be purchased with bank transfers, credit cards and debit cards. Coinmama specializes in credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. BitPanda is *ONLY* for people in Europe and has a 3-4% fee on credit and debit purchases. Read more about each [exchanges](/exchanges/) advantages here. In this example, we are going to use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004). If you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will recieve an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into Monaco on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/MCO pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Binance Bitcoin adress, which you can find by going to the Funds tab on the Binance navigation bar and then clicking "Deposits Withdrawls". Once on this screen, you will see a list of coins. Scroll down to Bitcoin, and hit the plus sign. This is the address you will copy and paste into Coinbase. Click send on Coinbase, and wait 15-30 minutes for your BTC to arrive.

Depending on the traffic on the Bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour. I know, waiting sucks, but this is still way faster than a bank transfer! 

## Step 3: Buy some Monaco!

After sending your bitcoin to Binance, you will want to go to the [BTC/MCO trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=MCO_BTC){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now hold Monaco!

## Method 2 - How to Buy Monaco with Changelly

 *Step 1:* Create an account on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. They have a relatively easy signup process and allow the use of Google, Twitter or Facebook for faster signups.

 *Step 2:* After creating an account, you will want to go to the main page as seen here, and use the conversion box. In this example, we are going to buy Monaco with USD!

## How to Buy Monaco with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Monaco with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Binance just like the above example!

## Can I Buy Monaco on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell Monaco. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including Monaco, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying Monaco, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for Monaco on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}

## How to Store you Monaco, Securely!

I reccomend keeping your Monaco on the [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/607d). This wallet suppots several cryptocurrencies, and is the most secure option.

If a Hardware Wallet isn't your style, you can store youe Monaco on myEtherwallet. Monaco is a coin that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that it can be stored on [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). 

To start using myEtherWallet, you will need to come up with a secure password. At the minimum, your password should be 9 characters long. After entering a password, press create new wallet. You will be taken to this screen where it asks to download a keystore file.
This keystore file is an encrypted private key, that gives you access to your funds. Please make a backup of this file, by storing another copy of it on a USB or other storage device. If you lose this, it is very difficult to recover your coins. 

![BuyAdex](/img/ethpass.png){: .medium-pic}

After clicking "I understand", it will ask you show you your private key, that is un encrypted. You can print a paper wallet through the website if you would like. A paper wallet is a document that contains all the neccesary data to access your cryptocurrency. Usually containing QR Codes and your private keys.


Next, it will ask you how you would like to access your wallet. We just downloaded our encrypted private key, so we will access it using this. Press "Keystore/JSON File", and select the encrypted private key file you just downloaded. Press unlock and we are pretty much done! Your public address will be shown below. This is where you can send your ERC-20 Coins. ERC-20 Coins are any cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain. This includes coins such as Monaco, Adex, and Decentraland.
