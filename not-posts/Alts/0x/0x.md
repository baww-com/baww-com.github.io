## How to Buy 0x with Credit Card and Debit Card

There is currently only one method of buying 0x with credit and debit cards. This is by converting your currency into Bitcoin, and then converting Bitcoin into 0x. The best exchange to get 0x on in my opinion is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. Look below for our tutorial on how to buy 0x!

## How to Buy 0x with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there is one method of buying 0x with a bank transfer or wire. This is done by converting Bitcoins purchased through a bank transfer into 0x, on an exchange such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. All will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> 0x


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Don’t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Each of these exchanges have their advantages. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. BitPanda is great for people in Europe and has a 5% fee on credit and debit purchases. In this example, we are going to use coinbase. If you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will recieve an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into 0x on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go top the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/ZRX pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Binance Bitcoin adress, which you can find by going to the Funds tab on the Binance navigation bar and then clicking "Deposits Withdrawls". Once on this screen, you will see a list of coins. Scroll down to Bitcoin, and hit the plus sign. This is the address you will copy and paste into Coinbase. Click send on Coinbase, and wait 15-30 minutes for your BTC to arrive.

## Step 3: Buy some 0x!

After your Bitcoin arrives, you will have a balance to purchase 0x with. Go to the [ZRX/BTC page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=ZRX_BTC) and you will see a box that says Buy 0x. In the box, enter a price you are comfortable buying 0x at. To get a good idea, you can check the order book on either side.

## How to Buy 0x with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying 0x with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) just like the above example!


## Can I Buy 0x on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004) does not sell 0x. In order to obtain 0x you can purchase Bitcoin on Coinbase, and then send it to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} where 0x is sold!

## Step 4: How to Store you 0x, Securely!

0x is a coin that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that it can be stored on [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). 

To start using myEtherWallet, you will need to come up with a secure password. At the minimum, your password should be 9 characters long. After entering a password, press create new wallet. You will be taken to this screen where it asks to download a keystore file.
This keystore file is an encrypted private key, that gives you access to your funds. Please make a backup of this file, by storing another copy of it on a USB or other storage device. If you lose this, it is very difficult to recover your coins. 

![0x](/img/ethpass.png){: .medium-pic}
![0x](/img/keystore.png){: .medium-pic}

After clicking "I understand", it will ask you show you your private key, that is un encrypted. You can print a paper wallet through the website if you would like. A paper wallet is a document that contains all the neccesary data to access your cryptocurrency. Usually containing QR Codes and your private keys.


Next, it will ask you how you would like to access your wallet. We just downloaded our encrypted private key, so we will access it using this. Press "Keystore/JSON File", and select the encrypted private key file you just downloaded. Press unlock and we are pretty much done! Your public address will be shown below. This is where you can send your ERC-20 Coins. ERC-20 Coins are any cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain. This includes coins such as 0x, Adex, and Decentraland. 

## What is the Circulating Supply of 0x?

At the time of this writing, there is a circulating supply of 481,119,279 0x. This will eventually reach the cap of 1,000,000,000 0x.
