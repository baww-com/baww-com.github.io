## How to Buy 0x with Bank Transfer

there is only one method of buying 0x with a bank transfer or wire: by converting Bitcoin into 0x, on an exchange like [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. See our clear step-by-step below!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> 0x


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin

There are several exchanges through which you can buy Bitcoin. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"} are the easiest to use. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit or debit transactions as it has higher purchase limits and quick delivery. BitPanda is great (it only works in Europe) and has a 5% fee on credit or debit purchases. We will use Coinbase in this example. Also, if you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will receive an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you donâ€™t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum. All of these cryptocurrencies can be converted into 0x on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, you are finished with this step! Next will be transferring the Bitcoin to a 0x exchange. Also, at this point, we strongly suggest setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) on all exchanges. Two factor authentication  combines two different verification methods to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

Once you have Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/ZRX pairs. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} is hugely popular due to its intuitive interface and solid customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipient's wallet address. Enter your Binance Bitcoin address, which you can find by going to the "Funds" tab on the Binance navigation bar, then clicking "Deposits Withdrawals". Once on this screen, you will see a list of coins. Scroll down to Bitcoin, and hit the "Deposit" button. Copy the address that appears and paste into Coinbase. Click send on Coinbase, and wait 15-30 minutes for your BTC to arrive.

## Step 3: Buy 0x on Binance

After your Bitcoin arrives, you will have a BTC balance with which to purchase 0x. Go to the [ZRX/BTC page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=ZRX_BTC) and you will see a box that says Buy 0x. In the box, enter the price with which you are comfortable buying 0x. To get a good idea, you can check the order book on either side of the console.

## How to Buy 0x with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying 0x with Paypal requires one extra step. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert your Paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Check out this tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have Bitcoin, you can send it to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) just like the above example.


## Can I Buy 0x on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004) does not sell 0x. In order to obtain 0x you can purchase Bitcoin on Coinbase, and then send it to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} where you can buy 0x!

## Step 4: How to Store 0x Securely

0x is a coin that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that it can be stored on [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/).

To start using myEtherWallet, you will need to come up with a secure password. Your password should be at least 9 characters long. After entering a password, click "create new wallet". You will be taken to this screen where it asks to download a keystore file.
A keystore file is an encrypted private key, that gives you access to your funds. Please make a backup of this file, by storing another copy of it on a USB or other storage device. If you lose this, it is very difficult to recover your coins.

![0x](/img/ethpass.png){: .medium-pic}
![0x](/img/keystore.png){: .medium-pic}

After clicking "I understand" it will show you your unencrypted private key. If you prefer, you can print a paper wallet through the website. A paper wallet is a document that contains all the data necessary to access your cryptocurrency, usually containing QR Codes and your private keys.

Next, myEtherWallet will ask you how you would like to access your wallet. You will access the wallet using the newly-downloaded encrypted private key. Click "Keystore/JSON File", and select the encrypted private key file you just downloaded. Press "unlock" and your public address will be displayed. This address is where you can send your ERC-20 Coins. ERC-20 Coins are any cryptocurrency that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This includes coins such as 0x, Tron, and OmiseGo.

## What is the Circulating Supply of 0x?

At the time of this writing, there is a circulating supply of 496,487,279 0x. This will eventually reach the cap of 1,000,000,000 0x.
