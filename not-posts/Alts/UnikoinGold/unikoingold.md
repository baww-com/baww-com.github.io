## How to Buy Unikoin Gold with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are two methods of buying Unikoin Gold with credit and debit cards. The first way, is by converting your currency into Bitcoin using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, and then converting your Bitcoin into Unikoin Gold on [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=22K26){:target="_blank"}. The second method, uses [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} and allows for the purchase of Unikoin Gold with USD.


## How to Buy Unikoin Gold with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there are two methods of buying Unikoin Gold with a bank transfer or wire. Both will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps! The first way, is by buying Bitcoin on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} using your Bank account. After you purchase Bitcoin, you can send it to an exchange that sells Unikoin Gold. The cheapest exchange, that sells Unikoin Gold is [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=22K26){:target="_blank"}. All will be explained below with clear pictures and steps!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Unikoin Gold


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Donâ€™t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on.

 We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}.

Each of these exchanges have their advantages: 

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} is a very beginner friendly US based exchange, that sells cryptocurrency to most countries and all US states. To see if Coinbase supports your country, [check this link](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1392031-what-countries-are-buys-and-sells-available-in-)!


[Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"} is another option that focuses on credit and debit card purchases. Coinmama is great because they have higher debit and credit card purchasing limits than Coinbase, as well as instant delivery.

Lastly, if you are based in Europe, I would reccomend [Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Bitpanda is an exchange that also focuses on credit and debit card purchases. Their fees are slightly lower, but *only* sells Bitcoin to European countries.

## How to Buy Bitcoin on Coinbase

In this example, I will show you how to purchase Bitcoins on Coinbase. If you signup to [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} through this link, you will recieve an extra $10 worth of Bitcoin on your first $100+ order.


After creating your Coinbase account, you will want to add a payment method. If you are trying to get the most bang out of your buck, I would reccomend using a bank transfer. If time is a concern, maybe go with credit or debit card, as there is instant delivery! Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab at the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go to the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/UKG pairs. For Unikoin Gold, my favorite exchange is [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=22K26){:target="_blank"}.


 In order to send your Bitcoin from the exchange you bought Bitcoin on, to Kucoin, you will need locate your Bitcoin Kucoin deposit address. This can be found by going on Kucoin, and clicking the $ tab on the right side of the navigation bar. This page will show you all of your cryptocurrency deposit addresses. Locate the coin you are depositing, which in this case is Bitcoin.

 Now that we have our deposit address, we will need to send it from Coinbase.

## Step 4: How to Store you Unikoin Gold, Securely!

Unikoin Gold is a coin that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that it can be stored on [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). 

To start using myEtherWallet, you will need to come up with a secure password. At the minimum, your password should be 9 characters long. After entering a password, press create new wallet. You will be taken to this screen where it asks to download a keystore file. This keystore file is an encrypted private key, that gives you access to your funds. Please make a backup of this file, by storing another copy of it on a USB or other storage device. If you lose this, it is very difficult to recover your coins.

After clicking "I understand", it will ask you show you your private key, that is un encrypted. You can print a paper wallet through the website if you would like. A paper wallet is a document that contains all the neccesary data to access your cryptocurrency. Usually containing QR Codes and your private keys.


Next, it will ask you how you would like to access your wallet. We just downloaded our encrypted private key, so we will access it using this. Press "Keystore/JSON File", and select the encrypted private key file you just downloaded. Press unlock and we are pretty much done! Your public address will be shown below. This is where you can send your ERC-20 Coins. ERC-20 Coins are any cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain. This includes coins such as Unikoin Gold, Adex, and Decentraland.
