## How to Buy Unikoin Gold with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are two ways to buy Unikoin Gold with a credit or debit card. The first is to convert currency to Bitcoin using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, then converting your Bitcoin into Unikoin Gold on [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=22K26){:target="_blank"}. The second way is to use a credit or debit card on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} through which you can buy Unikoin Gold with USD.


## How to Buy Unikoin Gold with Bank Transfer

The best way to buy Unikoin Gold with a wire or bank transfer is to buy Bitcoin on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} using your bank account, then send it to an exchange that sells Unikoin Gold, like [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=22K26){:target="_blank"}. See our tutorial below for instructions.

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Unikoin Gold


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin
There are several exchanges through which you can buy Bitcoin.
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"} are the easiest to use.

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} is a very beginner friendly US based exchange, that sells cryptocurrency to most countries and all US states. To see if Coinbase supports your country, [check this link](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1392031-what-countries-are-buys-and-sells-available-in-)!
[Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"} handles credit or debit card purchases. Coinmama is great because they have higher credit or debit card purchasing limits than Coinbase, as well as fast delivery of your funds.
[Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Bitpanda is an exchange that processes credit or debit card purchases.

Their fees are slightly lower, but *ONLY* sells Bitcoin to residents of European Union (EU) countries.
Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit or debit transactions as it has higher purchase limits and quick delivery. BitPanda is great (but it only works in Europe) and has a 5% fee on credit or debit purchases.
We will use Coinbase in this example. Also, if you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will receive an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you donâ€™t have one already and then add your payment method.

After creating your Coinbase account, you need to add a payment method. If you are going for the route with the lowest fees, it is best to use a bank transfer. If timing is more important, use a credit or debit card, as this is much faster!
The Coinbase signup process takes time, but this is to ensure security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum. All of these cryptocurrencies can be converted into UnikoinGold on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go to the next step! After hitting Confirm Buy, you are finished with this step! Next will be transferring the Bitcoin to a Unikoin Gold exchange. Also, at this point, we strongly suggest setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) on all exchanges. Two factor authentication  combines two different verification methods to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 4: How to securely store Unikoin Gold


Unikon Gold is an ERC20 coin that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that it can be stored on [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/).
Unikon Gold is also easily and securely stored on the highly popular hardware wallet [Ledger Nano S!](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/607d)

In fact, all ERC20 tokens can be managed using a combination of Ledger Nano S (or Ledger Blue) using MyEtherWallet. Check out this [guide on Ledger's site.] (https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005200009)

To start using myEtherWallet, you will need to come up with a secure password. Your password should be at least 9 characters long. After entering a password, click "create new wallet". You will be taken to this screen where it asks to download a keystore file.
A keystore file is an encrypted private key, that gives you access to your funds. Please make a backup of this file, by storing another copy of it on a USB or other storage device. If you lose this, it is very difficult to recover your coins.


![BuyAdex](/img/ethpass.png){: .medium-pic}

After clicking "I understand" it will show you your unencrypted private key. If you prefer, you can print a paper wallet through the website. A paper wallet is a document that contains all the data necessary to access your cryptocurrency, usually containing QR Codes and your private keys.

Next, myEtherWallet will ask you how you would like to access your wallet. You will access the wallet using the newly-downloaded encrypted private key. Click "Keystore/JSON File", and select the encrypted private key file you just downloaded. Press "unlock" and your public address will be displayed. This address is where you can send your ERC-20 Coins. ERC-20 Coins are any cryptocurrency that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This includes coins such as 0x, OmiseGo, and Storj.

## What is the Circulating Supply of Unikoin Gold?

Currently, there is a circulating supply of approximately 134,250,000 Unikoin Gold. This will eventually reach a cap of 1,000,000,000 DRGN.
