## How to Buy TenX Pay Token with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are two methods of buying  TenX Pay Token with credit and debit cards. The first way, is by converting your currency into Bitcoin, and then converting Bitcoin into  TenX Pay Token. The second, using [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} is more instant and direct, but has slightly higher fees.

## How to Buy TenX Pay Token with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there are two methods of buying TenX Pay Token with a bank transfer or wire. Both will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> TenX Pay Token

## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you don’t have some already.

There are several exchanges to buy bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Each of these exchanges have their advantages. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly. Coinmama is great for credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. Lastly, BitPanda is great for people in Europe and has a 3-4% fee on credit and debit purchases. In this example, we are going to use coinbase. Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method.  Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into TenX Pay Token on exchanges such as [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Home/Markets){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use bitcoin.

I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has Bitcoin/PAY pairs. My favorite is Bittrex due to its simple interface and good customer support. ![Coinbasehome](/img/Coinbase3.png){: .medium-pic} Depending on the traffic on the bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour. I know, waiting sucks, but the blockchain is awesome and ensures bitcoins can't be double spended.

## Step 3: Buy some TenX Pay Token!

After sending your bitcoin to Bittrex, you will want to go to the [BTC/PAY trading page](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PAY){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now own TenX Pay Token!

## Method 2 - How to Buy TenX Pay Token with Changelly

Step 1: Create an account on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. They have a relatively easy signup process and allow the use of Google, Twitter or Facebook for faster signups.

Step 2: After creating an account, you will want to go to the main page as seen here, and use the conversion box. In this example, we are going to buy TenX Pay Token with USD!

## How to Buy TenX Pay Token with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Ten X Pay Token with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Bittrex just like the above example!
