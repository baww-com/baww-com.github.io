## How to Buy Ardor with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are two ways to buy Ardor with a credit or debit card. The first is to convert your currency into Bitcoin, and then converting Bitcoin into Ardor on an exchange like [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911). The second is to use [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} which is more direct and allows you to control the private keys for your coins.

## How to Buy Ardor with Bank Transfer

There are two ways to buy Ardor with a bank transfer or wire. See our tutorial below for instructions on each method.

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Ardor


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin.

There are several exchanges through which you can buy Bitcoin. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"} are the easiest to use. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit or debit transactions as it has higher purchase limits and quick delivery. BitPanda is great (it only works in Europe) and has a 5% fee on credit or debit purchases. We will use Coinbase in this example. Also, if you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will receive an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you donâ€™t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum. All of these cryptocurrencies can be converted into 0x on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, you are finished with this step! Next will be transferring the Bitcoin to a Ardor exchange. Also, at this point, we strongly suggest setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) on all exchanges. Two factor authentication  combines two different verification methods to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

### Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

Once you have Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/ARD pairs.  [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Home/Markets){:target="_blank"} is popular thanks to a zippy interface and great customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipient's wallet address. Enter your Bittrex Bitcoin address, which you can find by going to your wallets page on Bittrex, then clicking the plus + sign next to Bitcoin as seen in the second picture. Copy the bitcoin address and paste it into the recipient address box on Coinbase.

Depending on the traffic on the Bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour. Please do not worry!


## Step 3: Buy Ardor!

After sending your bitcoin to Bittrex, you will want to go to the [BTC/ADX trading page](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-ARDR){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio with which you are comfortable. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now have Ardor.

## How to Buy Ardor with Changelly

Step 1: Create an account on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. They have a relatively easy signup process and allow the use of Google, Twitter or Facebook logins to make the sign-up seamless and easy.

Step 2: Upon creating an account, go to the main page as seen here, and use the conversion box to initiate an exchange. In this example, we are going to buy Ardor with USD.

## How to Buy Ardor with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Ardor with Paypal requires one extra step. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have Bitcoin, you can send it to Bittrex as seen in the example above.


## Can I Buy Ardor on Coinbase?

Currently, Coinbase does not sell Ardor. If you want to buy Ardor, please follow the steps above. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} to get started!

## Step 4: How to securely store you Ardor

Because NXT, Ardor and Ignis all run on the same network, it is generally recommended that you use this [wallet](https://nxtplatform.org/download/) to store your Ardor coins.
