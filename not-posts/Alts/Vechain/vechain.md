## How to Buy Vechain with Credit Card and Debit Card

In order to get Vechain via a credit or debit card, you will need to buy Bitcoin with your card on a fiat to crypto exchange such as [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, and then send your Bitcoin to the crypto to crypto exchange [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} has the lowest fees and highest trading volume out of any exchange.


## How to Buy Vechain with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there is one method of buying Vechain with a bank transfer or wire. This is done by trading Bitcoin, obtained via a bank transfer to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, where Vechain is sold. All will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps!


## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Vechain


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Don’t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Each of these exchanges have their advantages. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. BitPanda is great for people in Europe and has a 5% fee on credit and debit purchases. In this example, we are going to use coinbase. If you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will recieve an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into Vechain on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go top the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/VEN pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Binance Bitcoin adress, which you can find by going to the Funds tab on the Binance navigation bar and then clicking "Deposits Withdrawls". Once on this screen, you will see a list of coins. Scroll down to Bitcoin, and hit the plus sign. This is the address you will copy and paste into Coinbase. Click send on Coinbase, and wait 15-30 minutes for your BTC to arrive.

## Step 3: Buy some Vechain!

After your Bitcoin arrives, you will have a balance to purchase Vechain with. Go to the [VEN/BTC page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=VEN_BTC) and you will see a box that says Buy Vechain. In the box, enter a price you are comfortable buying Vechain at. To get a good idea, you can check the order book on either side.

## How to Buy Vechain with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Vechain with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) just like the above example!


## Can I Buy Vechain on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell Vechain. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including Vechain, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying Vechain, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for Vechain on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}

## Step 4: How to Store you Vechain, Securely!

Vechain is a coin that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that it can be stored on [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). 

To start using myEtherWallet, you will need to come up with a secure password. At the minimum, your password should be 9 characters long. After entering a password, press create new wallet. You will be taken to this screen where it asks to download a keystore file.
This keystore file is an encrypted private key, that gives you access to your funds. Please make a backup of this file, by storing another copy of it on a USB or other storage device. If you lose this, it is very difficult to recover your coins. 

![EOS](/img/ethpass.png){: .medium-pic}

After clicking "I understand", it will ask you show you your private key, that is un encrypted. You can print a paper wallet through the website if you would like. A paper wallet is a document that contains all the neccesary data to access your cryptocurrency. Usually containing QR Codes and your private keys.


Next, it will ask you how you would like to access your wallet. We just downloaded our encrypted private key, so we will access it using this. Press "Keystore/JSON File", and select the encrypted private key file you just downloaded. Press unlock and we are pretty much done! Your public address will be shown below. This is where you can send your ERC-20 Coins. ERC-20 Coins are any cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain. This includes coins such as Vechain, OmiseGo, and Monaco. 

## What is the Circulating Supply of Vechain?

At the time of this writing, there is a circulating supply of 277,162,633 VEN. This will eventually reach the cap of 867,162,633 VEN.
