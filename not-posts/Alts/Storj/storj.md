## How to Buy Storj with Credit Card and Debit Card

The easiest and cheapest way to get Storj with a debit or credit card, is to buy Bitcoin with your credit or debit card, and then send it to an exchange that sells Storj. The exchange with the lowest fees, that sells Storj is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}.

## How to Buy Storj with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, the best way obtaining Storj with a Bank Transfer is to buy Bitcoin on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, and then send it to an exchange that sells Storj. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} is the cheapest exchange that sells Storj. All will be explained below, with pictures.

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Storj


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Don’t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Each of these exchanges have their advantages. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. BitPanda is great for people in Europe and has a 5% fee on credit and debit purchases. In this example, we are going to use coinbase. If you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will recieve an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into Storj on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go top the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

### Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/STORJ pairs. My favorite is [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Home/Markets){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Bittrex Bitcoin adress, which you can find  by going to your wallets page on Bittrex and click the plus sign next to Bitcoin as seen in the second picture. Copy and paste the address into the recipients box on Coinbase.

Depending on the traffic on the Bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour. I know, waiting sucks, but this still way faster than a bank! 


## Step 3: Buy some Storj!

After sending your bitcoin to Bittrex, you will want to go to the [BTC/STORJ trading page](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now hold Storj!

## How to Buy Storj with Changelly

Step 1: Create an account on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. They have a relatively easy signup process and allow the use of Google, Twitter or Facebook for faster signups.

Step 2: After creating an account, you will want to go to the main page as seen here, and use the conversion box. In this example, we are going to buy Storj with USD!

## How to Buy Storj with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Storj with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Bittrex just like the above example!


## Can I Buy Storj on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell Storj. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including Storj, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying Storj, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for Storj on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}

## How to Store Storj, Securely!

Storj is a coin that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that it can be stored on [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). 

To start using myEtherWallet, you will need to come up with a secure password. At the minimum, your password should be 9 characters long. After entering a password, press create new wallet. You will be taken to this screen where it asks to download a keystore file.
This keystore file is an encrypted private key, that gives you access to your funds. Please make a backup of this file, by storing another copy of it on a USB or other storage device. If you lose this, it is very difficult to recover your coins.

After clicking "I understand", it will ask you show you your private key, that is un encrypted. You can print a paper wallet through the website if you would like. A paper wallet is a document that contains all the neccesary data to access your cryptocurrency. Usually containing QR Codes and your private keys.


Next, it will ask you how you would like to access your wallet. We just downloaded our encrypted private key, so we will access it using this. Press "Keystore/JSON File", and select the encrypted private key file you just downloaded. Press unlock and we are pretty much done! Your public address will be shown below. This is where you can send your ERC-20 Coins. ERC-20 Coins are any cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain. This includes coins such as Storj, Adex, and Decentraland. 

## What is the Circulating Supply of Adex?

At the time of this writing, there is a circulating supply of 109,747,319 STORJ. This will eventually reach the cap of 424,999,998 STORJ.
