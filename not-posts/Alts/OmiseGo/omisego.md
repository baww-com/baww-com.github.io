## How to Buy OmiseGo with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are two methods of buying OmiseGo with credit and debit cards. The first way, is by converting your currency into Bitcoin, and then converting Bitcoin into OmiseGo. This can be done using [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) .The second, using [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} is more instant and direct, but has slightly higher fees.

## How to Buy OmiseGo with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there are two methods of buying OmiseGo with a bank transfer or wire. Both will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps!

## How to Buy OmiseGo with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying OmiseGo with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Binance just like the below example!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> OmiseGo


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you don’t have some already.

There are several exchanges to buy bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Each of these exchanges have their advantages. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly. Coinmama is great for credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. Lastly, BitPanda is great for people in Europe and has a 3-4% fee on credit and debit purchases. In this example, we are going to use coinbase. Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method.  Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into OmiseGo on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use bitcoin.

</table>

I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/OMG pairs. My favorite is [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/){:target="_blank"} because it has a simple interface and great customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in the screenshot below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Bittrex Bitcoin adress, which you can find by going to your wallets page on Bittrex and click the plus sign next to Bitcoin as seen in the second picture. Copy and paste the address into the recipients box on Coinbase. Sending Bitcoin to Bittrex takes 15-30 minutes usually. If it is a bit longer don't panic!

## Step 3: Buy some OmiseGo!

After sending your Bitcoin to Bittrex, you will want to go to the [BTC/OMG](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-OMG){:target="_blank"} trading page and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now hold OmiseGo! 


## Method 2 - How to Buy OmiseGo with Changelly

Step 1: Create an account on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"}. They have a relatively easy signup process and allow the use of Google, Twitter or Facebook for faster signups.

Step 2: After creating an account, you will want to go to the main page as seen here, and use the conversion box. In this example, we are going to buy Ripple with USD!

![Coinbasehome](/img/OMG2.png){: .medium-pic}
![Coinbasehome](/img/OMG3.png){: .medium-pic}

Step 3: Hit Confirm and then sent the payment to the adress! It's that easy! Crypto can be confusing at times, but we are happy to simplify it for you! In the next section we will discuss storage options.


## Can I Buy OmiseGo on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell OmiseGo. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including OmiseGo, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying OmiseGo, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for OmiseGo on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=OMG_BTC){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}.


## Step 4: How to Store you OmiseGo, Securely!

If you are interested in storing your OmiseGo on a hardware wallet, I would reccomend the [Ledger Nano S](). 

If you would like to use a free desktop alternative, you could use [Exodus](https://www.exodus.io/). I use Exodus, as it has shapeshift capabilites built in.

OmiseGo is a coin that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that it can be stored on [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). 

To start using myEtherWallet, you will need to come up with a secure password. At the minimum, your password should be 9 characters long. After entering a password, press create new wallet. You will be taken to this screen where it asks to download a keystore file.
This keystore file is an encrypted private key, that gives you access to your funds. Please make a backup of this file, by storing another copy of it on a USB or other storage device. If you lose this, it is very difficult to recover your coins. 

![BuyOmiseGo](/img/ethpass.png){: .medium-pic}
![BuyOmiseGo](/img/keystore.png){: .medium-pic}

After clicking "I understand", it will ask you show you your private key, that is un encrypted. You can print a paper wallet through the website if you would like. A paper wallet is a document that contains all the neccesary data to access your cryptocurrency. Usually containing QR Codes and your private keys.


Next, it will ask you how you would like to access your wallet. We just downloaded our encrypted private key, so we will access it using this. Press "Keystore/JSON File", and select the encrypted private key file you just downloaded. Press unlock and we are pretty much done! Your public address will be shown below. This is where you can send your ERC-20 Coins. ERC-20 Coins are any cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain. This includes coins such as OmiseGo, Adex, and Decentraland. 

### Does OmiseGo Run on the Ethereum Blockchain?

Yes, until they create their own OmiseGo blockchain, OMG will run on the ethereum blockchain.
