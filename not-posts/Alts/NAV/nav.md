## How to Buy NavCoin with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are two methods of buying NAV with credit and debit cards. The first way, is by converting your currency into Bitcoin, and then converting Bitcoin into NAV on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. The second, using [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} is more instant and direct, but has slightly higher fees.

## How to Buy Nav Coin with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there are two methods of buying NAV Coin with a bank transfer or wire. Both will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Nav Coin


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Don’t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Each of these exchanges have their advantages. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. BitPanda is great for people in Europe and has a 3-4% fee on credit and debit purchases. In this example, we are going to use coinbase. If you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will recieve an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into AdEx on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go top the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

  <td><a href="https://bittrex.com/">Bittrex</a></td>
  <td>Everywhere</td>
  <td>.25%</td>
 </tr>

### Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/ADX pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Bittrex Bitcoin adress, which you can find  by going to your wallets page on Binance and click the plus sign next to Bitcoin as seen in the second picture. Copy and paste the address into the recipients box on Coinbase.

Depending on the traffic on the Bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour. I know, waiting sucks, but this still way faster than a bank! 


## Step 3: Buy some Nav!

After sending your bitcoin to Binance, you will want to go to the [BTC/NAV trading page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=NAV_BTC){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now hold NAV Coin!

## How to Buy NAV with Changelly

At the time of this writing, Changelly is not selling NAV. If you are interested in obtaining NAV, I would reccomend using [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}.

## How to Buy Nav Coin with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying NAV with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Bittrex just like the above example!
