## How to Buy Binance BNB with Credit Card and Debit Card

There is currently only one method of buying Binance with a credit or debit card. This is to convert currency into Bitcoin, then converting Bitcoin into Binance (BNB).

## How to Buy Binance BNB with Bank Transfer

There is one method of buying Binance with a bank transfer or wire. Please see below for a detailed explanation.

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Binance Coin BNB


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin

There are several exchanges through which you can buy Bitcoin.    
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"} are the easiest to use.

Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit or debit transactions as it has higher purchase limits and quick delivery. BitPanda is great (but it only works in Europe) and has a 5% fee on credit or debit purchases. We will use Coinbase in this example. Also, if you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will receive an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you donâ€™t have one already.

After creating your Coinbase account, you need to add a payment method. If you are going for the route with the lowest fees, it is best to use a bank transfer. If timing is more important, use a credit or debit card, as this is much faster!

The Coinbase signup process takes time, but this is to ensure security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum.

All of these cryptocurrencies can be converted into 0x on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, you are finished with this step! Next will be transferring the Bitcoin to a BNB exchange. Also, at this point, we strongly suggest setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) on all exchanges. Two factor authentication  combines two different verification methods to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

Once you have Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/BNB pairs.
[Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} is hugely popular due to its intuitive interface and solid customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipient's wallet address. Enter your Binance Bitcoin address, which you can find by going to the "Funds" tab on the Binance navigation bar, then clicking "Deposits Withdrawals". Once on this screen, you will see a list of coins. Scroll down to Bitcoin, and hit the "Deposit" button. Copy the address that appears and paste into Coinbase. Click send on Coinbase, and wait about 30 minutes for your BTC to arrive.

## Step 3: Buy Binance!

Once your Bitcoin arrives, you will have a balance with which to purchase Binance. Go to the [BNB/BTC page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=BNB_BTC) and you will see a box that says Buy BNB. In the box, enter the price with which you are comfortable buying Aelf. To get a good idea, you can check the order book on either side of the console.

## How to Buy Binance with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Binance with Paypal requires one extra step. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have Bitcoin, you can send it to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) like the example above.


## Can I Buy Binance Coin on Coinbase?

Currently, Coinbase does not sell Binance. BNB is available on [Binance Exchange](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911)

## Step 4: How to securely store BNB

Binance BNB is a coin that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that it can be stored on [myEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/).

To start using myEtherWallet, you will need to come up with a secure password. At the minimum, your password should be 9 characters long. After entering a password, press create new wallet. You will be taken to this screen where it asks to download a keystore file.
This keystore file is an encrypted private key, that gives you access to your funds. Please make a backup of this file, by storing another copy of it on a USB or other storage device. If you lose this, it is very difficult to recover your coins.

After clicking "I understand" it will show you your unencrypted private key. If you prefer, you can print a paper wallet through the website. A paper wallet is a document that contains all the data necessary to access your cryptocurrency, usually containing QR Codes and your private keys.



Next, it will ask you how you would like to access your wallet. We just downloaded our encrypted private key, so we will access it using this. Press "Keystore/JSON File", and select the encrypted private key file you just downloaded. Press unlock and we are pretty much done! Your public address will be shown below. This is where you can send your ERC-20 Coins. ERC-20 Coins are any cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain. This includes coins such as Binance, Adex, and 0x.

## What is the Circulating Supply of Binance Coin?

At the time of this writing, there is a circulating supply of 99,000,000 BNB. This will eventually reach the cap of 199,013,968 BNB.
