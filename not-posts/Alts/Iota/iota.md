## How to Buy IOTA with Credit Card and Debit Card

The easiest way to get IOTA with a credit or debit card is to obtain Bitcoin, then trade BTC/IOTA pairs on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}.

[Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) is one of the most reliable crypto to crypto exchanges currently trading IOTA.

## How to Buy IOTA with Bank Transfer

Currently, it is not possible to directly acquire IOTA with your bank account. The easiest way to buy IOTA is to trade Bitcoin for IOTA on an exchange. Step-by-step below.

## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin
There are several exchanges through which you can buy Bitcoin. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"} are the easiest to use.

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} is a very beginner friendly US based exchange, that sells cryptocurrency to most countries and all US states. To see if Coinbase supports your country, [check this link](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1392031-what-countries-are-buys-and-sells-available-in-)!

[Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"} handles credit or debit card purchases. Coinmama is great because they have higher credit or debit card purchasing limits than Coinbase, as well as fast delivery of your funds.

[Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Bitpanda is an exchange that processes credit or debit card purchases. Their fees are slightly lower, but *ONLY* sells Bitcoin to residents of European Union (EU) countries.
Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit or debit transactions as it has higher purchase limits and quick delivery. BitPanda is great (but it only works in Europe) and has a 5% fee on credit or debit purchases.

We will use Coinbase in this example. Also, if you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will receive an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you donâ€™t have one already and then add your payment method.

After creating your Coinbase account, you need to add a payment method. If you are going for the route with the lowest fees, it is best to use a bank transfer. If timing is more important, use a credit or debit card, as this is much faster!

The Coinbase signup process takes time, but this is to ensure security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum. All of these cryptocurrencies can be converted into IOTA on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, you are finished with this step! Next will be transferring the Bitcoin to a IOTA exchange. Also, at this point, we strongly suggest setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) on all exchanges. Two factor authentication  combines two different verification methods to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer Bitcoin to Binance

Click send on Coinbase, and wait about 30 minutes for your BTC to arrive in your Binance wallet for the IOTA altcoin.

## How to Buy IOTA with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying IOTA with paypal requires more effort. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have Bitcoin, you can send it to Binance just like example above.

## Can I Buy IOTA on Coinbase?

Coinbase does not currently sell IOTA. If you want to buy IOTA, please follow the steps detailed above. You can trade Bitcoin for IOTA on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} to get started.


##  How to securely store IOTA

Install the offical [IOTA wallet](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases){:target="_blank"}. Download the corresponding wallet for your device operating system.

### Mac Installation Steps

*Step 1:* Drag the IOTA Wallet into your applications.
![IOTA](/img/iot.png)

*Step 2:* Open the IOTA Wallet, by right clicking and selecting Open. This will help you get past the application not trusted pop-up. This is only becuase IOTA is not a trusted developer, but the application is considered safe to use.

*Step 3:* You will have the option to run a light or full node. For most users, light node is favorable as it does not require you to download the entire tangle. If you decide to run a full node, you will download the entire tangle, which requires your computer to have Java. It will then ask you to pick a host. (ex. http://iota.bitfinex.com:80).

![IOTA](/img/iot2.png){: .medium-pic}

*Step 4:* Enter a Seed: an IOTA Seed is a unique passcode that will allow you to access your IOTA Wallet. Please keep this seed confidential. The IOTA Seed is 81 characters long, containing capital letters and the digit 9. You can create your own seed or use the website [iotaseed.io](https://iotaseed.io/){:target="_blank"} to generate one more quickly. At the bottom of iotaseed.io, there are mnemonic words codifying the IOTA seed, save these words somewhere NOT on your computer, but somehwere else that is secure (piece of paper in a safe deposit box, for example). If you lose your seed it is possible to recover the wallet with this series of words.


*Step 5:* You can send or receive IOTA by clicking the corresponding buttons. If you want receive IOTA from someone, click receive to display your public address. When you click Send, you will see an option to add a prefix. These prefixes: i, Ki, Mi, Gi, and Ti -  correspond to the amount of IOTA being sent. IOTA bought from an exchange is called MEGA IOTA. Here is a table explaining the prefixes.

![IOTA](/img/IOTAWALLET.png){: .medium-pic}
![IOTA](/img/IOTA5wallet.png){: .medium-pic}

These increase by orders of magnitude by powers of 10.

Teraiota Ti = 1,000,000,000,000

Gigaiota Gi = 1,000,000,000

Megaiota Mi = 1,000,000

Kiliiota Ki = 1,000

Iota i = 1


## How to Mine IOTA

IOTA is one of the few cryptocurrencies in which there is no mining. This is because all of the IOTA that will ever exist, has alredy been created. IOTA has a built in deflationary mechanism, which means that as IOTA are lost the total supply decreases. If you want to help the network, you can do this by sending a transaction. Before your transaction goes through, your node must verify two other transactions first.


## Can I buy IOTA in my Country?

If you can purchase Bitcoin, then you are able to purchase IOTA on an exchange such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}.

## Why is 9 the Only Number in an IOTA Seed?

IOTA is written as a ternary system and uses 27 characters, which are the characters A-Z, and the number 9. The number 9 is used instead of 0 because 0 looks similar to the letter O.
