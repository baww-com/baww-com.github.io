## How to Buy IOTA with Credit Card and Debit Card

The easiest way to obtain IOTA with a credit or debit card is to obtain Bitcoin, and trade BTC/IOTA pairs on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) is the best most relaible exchange that sells IOTA in MY opinion. If you are in the US, Binance is pretty much your only option as Bitfinex has recently shut down US accounts. This may sound confusing, but this tutorial will clear up all questions, with text and pictures!

## How to Buy IOTA with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, at the moment there is no low fee way to directly aquire IOTA with your bank account. The simplest way to get IOTA is by trading Bitcoin for IOTA on an exchange. All your questions will be answered below!

## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Don’t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Coinbase has a very beginner friendly interface, and allows Bitcoin's to be purchased with bank transfers, credit cards and debit cards. Coinmama specializes in credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. BitPanda is *ONLY* for people in Europe and has a 3-4% fee on credit and debit purchases. Read more about each [exchanges](/exchanges/) advantages here. In this example, we are going to use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004). If you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will recieve an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into IOTA on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/IOTA pairs. If you bought on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} click the accounts tab to get to the page seen below. For IOTA, [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) is the best exchange. In order to send our Bitcoin to Binance, we need our Binance wallet address. If you don't already have an account on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911), create one. After your account is created, click the funds tab on the navigation bar, and then press "Deposits Withdrawals". On this screen, you will see several cryptocurrencies. Find the cryptocurrency you are depositing, so in this example Bitcoin. Click Deposit, and a BTC Deposit address will show up. Copy and paste this address into Coinbase, click send, and wait 15-20 minutes for your currency to arrive on Binance.

## Step 3: Buy some IOTA!

After sending your Bitcoin to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911), you will want to go to the [BTC/IOTA](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=IOTA_BTC) trading page and enter a ratio you are comfortable with. You can look at the orderbook and see the going rates. After your order is processed, you now hold IOTA!

## How to Buy IOTA with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying IOTA with paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to Binance just like the above example!


## Can I Buy IOTA on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell IOTA. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including IOTA, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying IOTA, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for IOTA on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}


##  How to Store you IOTA, Securely!

Now that you own IOTA, you are probably wondering how to store it, securely. Start off by installing the offical [IOTA wallet](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases){:target="_blank"}. Download the corresponding wallet to your operationg system. If you are on a Mac, download the .dmg, and if you are on a PC, download the .exe!

### Mac Installation Steps

*Step 1:* Drag the IOTA Wallet into your applications.
![IOTA](/img/iot.png) 

*Step 2:* Open the IOTA Wallet, if your Mac shows a popup saying this application is not trusted, try right clicking and the pressing open. This download file is 100% safe!

*Step 3:* Next up, it will ask you to run a light or full node. I highly reccomend using the light version. If you decide to run a full node, you will download the entire tangle, which requires your computer to have Java. It will then ask you to pick a host. I chose the first option, http://iota.bitfinex.com:80. 

![IOTA](/img/iot2.png){: .medium-pic} 

*Step 4:* Enter a Seed! An IOTA Seed is a unique passcode to access your IOTA Wallet. Please keep this to yourself. A proper IOTA Seed is 81 characters long, containing capital letters, and the number 9. You can come up with your own seed, or use the website [iotaseed.io](https://iotaseed.io/){:target="_blank"}. At the bottom of iotaseed.io, you will see your seed encoded as mnemonic words, save these words somewhere safe! Incase your seed is lost, you can recover it with those words.


*Step 5:* We are pretty much done! You can send or recieve IOTA by clicking the corresponding buttons. If you want recieve IOTA from soneone, click receieve and your public address will be revealed! If you click send, you will see an option to add a prefix. The prefixes are i, Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti. These correspond to the amount of IOTA you are sending. When you buy IOTA from an exchange, you are buying MEGA IOTA. Here is a table explaining the prefixes.

![IOTA](/img/IOTAWALLET.png){: .medium-pic} 
![IOTA](/img/IOTA5wallet.png){: .medium-pic} 

These increase by orders of magnitude by powers of 10.

Teraiota Ti = 1,000,000,000,000 

Gigaiota Gi = 1,000,000,000 

Megaiota Mi = 1,000,000 

Kiliiota Ki = 1,000 

Iota i = 1 


## How to Mine IOTA

IOTA is one of the few cryptocurrencies that require no mining. All of the IOTA that will ever exist, exist now. It is deflationary, so as IOTA are lost the total supply decreases. If your goal is to help the network, you can do this by sending a transaction. Before your transaction goes through, you will verify two other transactions. You act as a sort of node by doing this, however I wouldn't reccomend it.


## Is IOTA Allowed in my Country?

If you are able to purchase cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, then you are able to purchase IOTA!

## Why is 9 the Only Number in an IOTA Seed?

 The reason only the number 9 is used, is because IOTA is written in ternary, which uses 27 characters. The 27 values are the characters A-Z, and 9. They use 9 instead of 0 because 0 looks similar to O.
