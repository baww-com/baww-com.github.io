## How to Buy Verge with Credit Card and Debit Card

There is currently only one method of buying Verge with credit and debit cards. This is by converting your currency into Bitcoin, and then converting Bitcoin into Verge. 

## How to Buy Verge with Bank Transfer

Just like credit and debit cards, there is one method of buying Verge with a bank transfer or wire. All will be explained below, with clear pictures and steps!

## Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> Verge


## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin if you Don’t have Some Already.

There are several exchanges to buy Bitcoin on. We reccomend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Each of these exchanges have their advantages. Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit and debit transactions as it has very high purchase limits and instant delivery. BitPanda is great for people in Europe and has a 5% fee on credit and debit purchases. In this example, we are going to use coinbase. If you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will recieve an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you don’t have one already and then add your payment method. Coinbases signup process may take some time, but this ensures security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All of these can be converted into EOS on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, we are ready to go top the next step! I highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication on all exchanges. Two factor authentication combines two different components to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

After aquiring Bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/XVG pairs. My favorite is [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"} due to its simple interface and good customer support. Click the send button on Coinbase as seen in red highlight in the picture below. You will be asked for the recipients wallet adress. You will want to enter your Binance Bitcoin adress, which you can find by going to the Funds tab on the Binance navigation bar and then clicking "Deposits Withdrawls". Once on this screen, you will see a list of coins. Scroll down to Bitcoin, and hit the plus sign. This is the address you will copy and paste into Coinbase. Click send on Coinbase, and wait 15-30 minutes for your BTC to arrive.

## Step 3: Buy some Verge!

After your Bitcoin arrives, you will have a balance to purchase Verge with. Go to the [XVG/BTC page](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=XVG_BTC) and you will see a box that says Buy Verge. In the box, enter a price you are comfortable buying Verge at. To get a good idea, you can check the order book on either side.

## How to Buy Verge with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Verge with Paypal takes a few extra steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have obtained Bitcoin, you can send it to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911) just like the above example!


## Can I Buy Verge on Coinbase?

At the time of this writing, Coinbase does not sell Verge. There have been several rumors however, and many think that in early 2018 we will see several new coins, including Verge, added to Coinbase. If you are interested in buying Verge, just follow the steps above! You can trade Bitcoin's for Verge on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}. If you don't own any Bitcoin, use [Coinbase!](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}

## Step 4: How to Store you Verge, Securely!

Verge can be stored on the [offical Verge Wallet](https://vergecurrency.com/#wallets).
