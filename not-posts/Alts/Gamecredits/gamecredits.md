## How to Buy GameCredits with Credit Card and Debit Card

There are two ways to buy GameCredits with a credit or debit card. The first is to convert currency into Bitcoin, then convert Bitcoin into GameCredits. The second is to purchase through [Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=4af50f9c87f2){:target="_blank"} which is more instant and direct, but has higher fees.

## How to Buy GameCredits with Bank Transfer

There are two ways to buy GameCredits with a bank transfer or wire. Please see explanation below.

##Method 1 - USD/EUR -> BTC -> GAME

## Step 1: Buy Bitcoin

There are several exchanges through which you can buy Bitcoin.

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"}, [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"}, or [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"} are the easiest to use.

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} is a very beginner friendly US based exchange, that sells cryptocurrency to most countries and all US states. To see if Coinbase supports your country, [check this link](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1392031-what-countries-are-buys-and-sells-available-in-)!

[Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"} handles credit or debit card purchases. Coinmama is great because they have higher credit or debit card purchasing limits than Coinbase, as well as fast delivery of your funds.
[Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"}. Bitpanda is an exchange that processes credit or debit card purchases. Their fees are slightly lower, but *ONLY* sells Bitcoin to residents of European Union (EU) countries.

Coinbase is the most beginner friendly while Coinmama is great for credit or debit transactions as it has higher purchase limits and quick delivery. BitPanda is great (but it only works in Europe) and has a 5% fee on credit or debit purchases.

We will use Coinbase in this example. Also, if you purchase over $100 of Bitcoin through the following link, you will receive an extra $10 BTC for FREE! Create an account [on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} if you donâ€™t have one already and then add your payment method.

After creating your Coinbase account, you need to add a payment method. If you are going for the route with the lowest fees, it is best to use a bank transfer. If timing is more important, use a credit or debit card, as this is much faster!

The Coinbase signup process takes time, but this is to ensure security for customers. Click the Buy/Sell tab on the top/middle of your screen. From this page, you can easily purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum. All of these cryptocurrencies can be converted into GameCredits on exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18991911){:target="_blank"}, but for this tutorial we will use Bitcoin.

After hitting Confirm Buy, you are finished with this step! Next will be transferring the Bitcoin to a GameCredits exchange. Also, at this point, we strongly suggest setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) on all exchanges. Two factor authentication  combines two different verification methods to ensure the real user is trying to access the account.

## Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin

Once you have bitcoin, you will need to move it to an exchange that has BTC/GAME pairs. Bittrex is a great option as it features a simple interface and great customer service. Click the send button in your BTC wallet, as shown in the below picture. You will be asked for the recipients wallet address. You can find this by going to your wallets page on Bittrex and click the plus + sign next to Bitcoin. Then, copy and paste this address - do not try to type it, an error can result in your funds being lost forever - into the recipients box in Coinbase.

Depending on the traffic on the Bitcoin network, your transfer may take 20 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer. This can be stressful but do not worry!

## Step 3: Buy GameCredits

After sending your bitcoin to Bittrex, you will want to go to the [BTC/GAME trading page](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-GAME){:target="_blank"} and enter a ratio with which you are comfortable. You can look at the orderbook to see the current market rates. Once your order is processed, you now will see GameCredits in your Bittrex wallet balance.

## How to Buy Gamecredits with PayPal

Due to Paypal's chargeback feature, buying Gamecredits with Paypal requires some more steps. The exchange [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} allows you to convert paypal balance into Bitcoin. [Read our tutorial on this conversion](/buy-bitcoin/paypal/). Once you have Bitcoin, you can send it to Bittrex as seen in the example above.
