## Best Dash Mining Pools

The best three Dash Mining pools in my opinion are [poolmining.org](https://poolmining.org/pool/dash){:target="_blank"}, [Dash SuperNova](https://dash.suprnova.cc/){:target="_blank"} and [Minergate](https://minergate.com/){:target="_blank"}. Please note that I am NOT affilated with any of these pools, and do not receieve any benefits from sending you to them. They are ranked in no particular order, but just listed with their pro's and cons.


1. [PoolMining.org](https://poolmining.org/pool/dash){:target="_blank"} - This pool has a .15% fee, which is pretty low, and has a minimum payout of .1 Dash. .1 Dash might be a bit high as the price has Dash has recently increased to over $1000.


2. [Minergate](https://minergate.com/){:target="_blank"} - The most beginner friendly pool by far. The minergate download comes with an easy to use GUI (Graphical User Interface), and allows you to switch your miner to the most profitable coin at the time. What I like about doing that is that you can sell whatever coin is the most profitable for you to mine, straight into Dash!

3. [SuperNova](https://dash.suprnova.cc/){:target="_blank"} - SuperNova has a 0% fee, so this might be the best option. 


## Is Dash the Most Profitable Coin to Mine?

There are currently other coins that are more profitable to mine, but there are other reasons to mine coins that aren't the most profitable. If you are curious in finding the most profitable coin to mine, check out [whattomine](http://whattomine.com/){:target="_blank"}.

## Why Should I Join a Mining Pool?

When you're in a mining pool, you group together your hashing power to receieve block rewards more often, you then receive a portion of the reward proportional to the amount of work you contributed.
