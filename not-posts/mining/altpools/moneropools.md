## Best Monero Mining Pools

The top three Monero Mining pools in my opinion are moneropool.com, minexmr.com and [minergate](https://minergate.com/). Please note that I am NOT affilated with any of these pools, and do not receieve any benefits from sending you to them. They are ranked in no particular order, but just listed with their pro's and cons.


1. [MoneroPool](https://moneropool.com/) - MoneroPool is a pool that requires no registration, but has a pool fee of 1.9%. This is towards the higher end. Expect a .5 XMR payout threshold. This means that you will not be paid before mining half a monero! They also have a mining calculator on the site if you are curious to see how profitable this pool will be for you!

2. [MineXMR.com](http://minexmr.com/) - I personnaly haven't used this pool, but they have a 1% pool fee, which is around the middle of the range you can expect.

3. [Minergate](https://minergate.com/) - The most beginner friendly pool by far. The minergate download comes with an easy to use GUI (Graphical User Interface), and allows you to switch your miner to the most profitable coin at the time. What I like about doing that is that you can sell whatever coin is the most profitable for you to mine, straight into Monero!

There are currently other coins that are more profitable to mine, but there are other reasons to mine coins that aren't the most profitable. If you are curious in finding the most profitable coin to mine, check out [whattomine](http://whattomine.com/).
