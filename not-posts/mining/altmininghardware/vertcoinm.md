## Is Vertcoin Mining Proftiable?

At the time of this writing, Vertcoin mining is profitable, especially if you have access to cheap or free electricity. Vertcoin is an ASIC resistant coin, so your best option is using a GPU. In my opinion, NVIDIA is the best mining option for Vertcoin, but AMD works just fine. If you already own a GPU, then scroll down to find out One Click Miner guide. 

## Best Vertcoin Mining Hardware

For the purposes of this guide, I will assume you own no mining hardware. Listed below are my reccomendations for a GPU, Power Supply, Motherboard, Processor, RAM, and SSD. Alot of these components are universal for Cryptocurrency mining, and are not just for Vertcoin.

If you are interested in mining Vertcoin, you will first need a GPU. I would 100% reccomend the [GeForce GTX 1080](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FASUS-GeForce-GTX-1080-Ti-DirectX-12-TURBO-GTX1080TI-11G-11GB-352-Bit-GDDR5X-PCI%2F382177688689%3Fepid%3D738097086%26hash%3Ditem58fb90bc71%3Ag%3A368AAOSwEotZ0sHE){:target="_blank"}. The 1070 has an upfront cost of around ~$400 and is reported to mine around 38 MH/S. You will find some of the quickest return on investment with this GPU. 

For a power supply, I would reccomend the [Corsair HX1000i](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.m570.l1311.R3.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xcorsair%2Bhx.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dcorsair%2Bhx1000i%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"}. The Corsair HX1000i is an 1000W PSU, and has 6 PCIE slots. This is important because with just one of these, you can support up to *[4 1070s!](http://amzn.to/2xB2Dhq){:target="_blank"}*.

If you don't already own a motherboard, then I would suggest using the [ASUS Prime Z270](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dradeon%2Brx%2Bvega%2B64%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1311.R1.TR10.TRC1.A0.H0.Xasus%2Bprime%2Bz.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dasus%2Bprime%2Bz270-a%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"}.

A good cheap processor for all mining rigs is the [Intel Celeron G3900](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FNew-Intel-Celeron-G3900-Skylake-Dual-Core-2-8-GHz-LGA-1151-65W-BX80662G3900%2F272983283845%3Fepid%3D2254421607%26hash%3Ditem3f8f125885%3Ag%3AJs0AAOSwiHpaMxK1){:target="_blank"}.

For RAM, I would go with [Ballistix Sport LT 8GB](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FBallistix-Sport-LT-8GB-2-x-4GB-288-Pin-DDR4-SDRAM-DDR4-2400-PC4-19200-Deskto%2F302186302490%3Fepid%3D11011375574%26hash%3Ditem465bb50c1a%3Ag%3AF5AAAOSw4QVZz728){:target="_blank"}. 

Lastly, a good SSD is the [Kingston A400](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FKingston-A400-120GB-Internal-SATA-Solid-State-Drive-for-Laptops-and-Desktops%2F202062633818%3Fepid%3D2255075931%26hash%3Ditem2f0bdf1b5a%3Ag%3ADhIAAOSwnHZYkxhk){:target="_blank"}. 120 GB is more than fine for a mining setup. if you intented to use the SSD for other purposes consider getting a higher amount of GB.



## Vertcoin Mining Software - One Click Miner

In order to start mining vertcoin, I reccomend downloading One Click Miner. One Click Miner is software with an easy to understand interface that allows you to easily download and control miner software for CPU's and AMD/Nvidia GPU's. It also has integrated P2Pool functionality.

### Step 1: Download One Click Miner [here](https://github.com/vertcoin/One-Click-Miner/releases){:target="_blank"}.

### Step 2: Launch One Click Miner

### Step 3: Link to a P2Pool Node

Click the "Find P2Pool Nodes" button and then click "scan" to fine a node. If your mining hardware is capable of mining over 100 MH/S, I reccomend using Network One. Otherwise, join Network 2 to maximize your profits.

### Step 4: Insert your Vertcoin wallet address.

This adress is where your Vertcoin will be sent to.

### Step 5: Select your Method

Vertcoin allows CPU Mining, NVIDIA Mining, and AMD Mining. I reccomend NVIDIA or AMD to maximize your mining profits. Once you have selected your miner, press start. You may be asked for an update. After the update, you are now mining Vertcoin!
