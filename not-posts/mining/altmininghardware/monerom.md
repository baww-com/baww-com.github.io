## Is Monero Mining Proftiable?

At the time of this writing, Monero mining is profitable, especially if you have access to cheap or free electricity. Monero's price has recently hit over $400 a coin! Monero is a privacy focused coin, and mining is one of the most private ways to obtain the coin! Below we will list the best methods and hardware setups to obtain the king of privacy coins!

## Best Monero Mining Hardware

Your next mining hardware purchase will depend on whether you already have an assembled PC/Miner, or if you are planning to build one from scratch.

If you are looking to build a completely new miner, you will need the following components. Motherboard, CPU, Memory, GPU, PSU, a Case, Hard Drive, Operating System and Risers.


## Best Monero Mining Motherboard

An important attribute of a good mining motherboard is one with several PCI-E slots. I would highly suggest the [ASUS Prime Z270](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dradeon%2Brx%2Bvega%2B64%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1311.R1.TR10.TRC1.A0.H0.Xasus%2Bprime%2Bz.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dasus%2Bprime%2Bz270-a%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"}. This motherboard has 7 PCI-E Slots!! This means as long as your power supply can support 7 miners, you can attach 7 GPU's to ONE motherboard.


## Best Monero Mining CPU

 Next up, is the CPU. CPU mining is a thing of the past, as GPU's are more powerful. However, a miner still needs a CPU to function. This is a miner slot we can afford to be cheap on! I would reccomend using the [Intel Celeron G3900](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FNew-Intel-Celeron-G3900-Skylake-Dual-Core-2-8-GHz-LGA-1151-65W-BX80662G3900%2F272983283845%3Fepid%3D2254421607%26hash%3Ditem3f8f125885%3Ag%3AJs0AAOSwiHpaMxK1){:target="_blank"}. 


## Best Monero Mining GPU's

 For your GPU, you will want something powerful. The more money you spend on a GPU, the more hashrate it will deliver. There is a direct correlation to Hashrate and coins mined. For those of you who are going big, without a doubt you should choose the [Radeon RX Vega 64 GB](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dvictony%2Bpcie%2Brisers%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1311.R1.TR6.TRC1.A0.H1.Xradeon%2Brx%2Bvega%2B64.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dradeon%2Brx%2Bvega%2B64%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"}. This card has a reported hash rate of 11,750, which should earn you .1 Monero A DAY. If you fill your PCI-E slots, you should expect to mine .7 Monero a day, which is a lot! That is around $180! Keep in mind electricity costs will subtract from part of your income.

 If you want to go budget on your GPU miner, which in my opinion is the miner slot you shouldn't go cheap on, I would reccomend the [AMD R9-280X](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dxfx%2Br9%2B290%26_osacat%3D175673%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR3.TRC1.A0.H0.Xxfx%2Br9%2B280x.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dxfx%2Br9%2B280x%26_sacat%3D175673){:target="_blank"}. This will cost ~$180. Getting 7 of these to fill your PCI-E slots will cost you around $1500.


## Best Monero RAM and Hardrive

For RAM, I would go with [Ballistix Sport LT 8GB](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FBallistix-Sport-LT-8GB-2-x-4GB-288-Pin-DDR4-SDRAM-DDR4-2400-PC4-19200-Deskto%2F302186302490%3Fepid%3D11011375574%26hash%3Ditem465bb50c1a%3Ag%3AF5AAAOSw4QVZz728){:target="_blank"}


You'll want an SSD, I reccomend the [Kingston A400](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FKingston-A400-120GB-Internal-SATA-Solid-State-Drive-for-Laptops-and-Desktops%2F202062633818%3Fepid%3D2255075931%26hash%3Ditem2f0bdf1b5a%3Ag%3ADhIAAOSwnHZYkxhk){:target="_blank"}


## Best Monero Power Supply PSU

The Power Supply and the GPU are in my opinion the most important slot for any miner. Depending on how many cards you end up mining with, I would reccomend the [Corsair HX1000i](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.m570.l1311.R3.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xcorsair%2Bhx.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dcorsair%2Bhx1000i%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"}, or the [EVGA 1000 GQ PSU](http://amzn.to/2z5vZ7t){:target="_blank"}. The EVGA 1000 GQ is pretty much required if you decide to mine with over 3 GPU's.

## Best Monero Mining Case

Cases, outside of wiring and cooling, are all cosmetic. I wouldn't know what case looks best to you, but I will show you one I like! Depending on how many GPU's you are using, this case may not work. A lot of times people make their own cases to fit the space they are mining in. The [Corsair Carbide Case](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dcorsair%2Bhx1000i%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xcorsair%2Bcarbide.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dcorsair%2Bcarbide%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"} provides style with a relatively low cost. Expect great airflow and spacing from this case.


## Best Monero Mining Operating System

The operating system for your miner doesn't matter a whole lot. [Windows 10](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dcorsair%2Bcarbide%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xwindows%2B10.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dwindows%2B10%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"} is my operating system of choice.


## Best Monero Mining Risers

I would reccomend this 6 pack of [VICTONY PCI-E Risers](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dwindows%2B10%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xvictony%2Bpcie%2Briser.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dvictony%2Bpcie%2Brisers%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"}.
