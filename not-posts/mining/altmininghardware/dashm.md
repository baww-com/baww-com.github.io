## Is Dash Mining Proftiable?

At the time of this writing, Dash mining is profitable, especially if you have access to cheap or free electricity. Dash mining can be done with ASICS, which stands for application specific integrated circuit. ASICS allows massive amounts of hashing power and can allow for massive return on investment.

## Best Dash Mining Hardware

For the purposes of this guide, I will assume you own no mining hardware. Listed below are my reccomendations for an ASIC or GPU, Power Supply, Motherboard, Processor, RAM, and SSD. Alot of these components are universal for Cryptocurrency mining, and are not just for Dash. 

If you are interested in mining Dash, you will first need a GPU or ASIC. The [Antminer D3](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Devga%2B1000%2Bgq%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.Xantminer%2Bd3.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dantminer%2Bd3%26_sacat%3D0) is defintetly worth the initial investment as it can mine for over $200 a day. I reccomend using the website cryptocompare to see how profitable it will be for you. If you decide to go the GPU route, I would 100% reccomend the [GeForce GTX 1080](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FASUS-GeForce-GTX-1080-Ti-DirectX-12-TURBO-GTX1080TI-11G-11GB-352-Bit-GDDR5X-PCI%2F382177688689%3Fepid%3D738097086%26hash%3Ditem58fb90bc71%3Ag%3A368AAOSwEotZ0sHE){:target="_blank"}. The 1070 has an upfront cost of around ~$400. You will find some of the quickest return on investment with this GPU. 

The best power supply will depend on whether you are using an ASIC or GPU. If you are using an ASIC, I reccomend getting this [Antminer D3 Power Supply](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dantminer%2Bpower%2Bsupply%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xantminer%2Bpower%2Bsupply%2Bd3.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dantminer%2Bpower%2Bsupply%2Bd3%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"}. The Antminer D3 will provide unrivaled hashing power for an increased initial cost. Once the initial cost is covered, you will be making very good passive income. If you decided to get a GPI instead, I would reccomend the [Corsair HX1000i](http://amzn.to/2gPCkgO){:target="_blank"}. The Corsair HX1000i is an 1000W PSU, and has 6 PCIE slots. This is important because with just one of these, you can support up to *[4 1070s!](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.m570.l1311.R3.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xcorsair%2Bhx.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dcorsair%2Bhx1000i%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"}*.

If you don't already own a motherboard, then I would suggest using the [ASUS Prime Z270](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dradeon%2Brx%2Bvega%2B64%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1311.R1.TR10.TRC1.A0.H0.Xasus%2Bprime%2Bz.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dasus%2Bprime%2Bz270-a%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"}.

A good cheap processor for all mining rigs is the [Intel Celeron G3900](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FNew-Intel-Celeron-G3900-Skylake-Dual-Core-2-8-GHz-LGA-1151-65W-BX80662G3900%2F272983283845%3Fepid%3D2254421607%26hash%3Ditem3f8f125885%3Ag%3AJs0AAOSwiHpaMxK1){:target="_blank"}.

For RAM, I would go with [Ballistix Sport LT 8GB](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FBallistix-Sport-LT-8GB-2-x-4GB-288-Pin-DDR4-SDRAM-DDR4-2400-PC4-19200-Deskto%2F302186302490%3Fepid%3D11011375574%26hash%3Ditem465bb50c1a%3Ag%3AF5AAAOSw4QVZz728){:target="_blank"}. 

Lastly, a good SSD is the [Kingston A400](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FKingston-A400-120GB-Internal-SATA-Solid-State-Drive-for-Laptops-and-Desktops%2F202062633818%3Fepid%3D2255075931%26hash%3Ditem2f0bdf1b5a%3Ag%3ADhIAAOSwnHZYkxhk){:target="_blank"}. 120 GB is more than fine for a mining setup. if you intented to use the SSD for other purposes consider getting a higher amount of GB.
