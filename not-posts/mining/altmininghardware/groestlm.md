## Is Groestlcoin Mining Proftiable?

At the time of this writing, Groestlcoin mining is profitable, especially if you have access to cheap or free electricity. Groestlcoin price has recently hit over $2.30 a coin! Groestlcoin is an asic resistant mining coin, which is great for the average miner!

## Best Groestlcoin Mining Hardware

Your next mining hardware purchase will depend on whether you already have an assembled PC/Miner, or if you are planning to build one from scratch.

If you are looking to build a completely new miner, you will need the following components. Motherboard, CPU, Memory, GPU, PSU, a Case, Hard Drive, Operating System and Risers.


## Best Groestlcoin Mining Motherboard

An important attribute of a good mining motherboard is one with several PCI-E slots. I would highly suggest the [ASUS Prime Z270](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dradeon%2Brx%2Bvega%2B64%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1311.R1.TR10.TRC1.A0.H0.Xasus%2Bprime%2Bz.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dasus%2Bprime%2Bz270-a%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"}. This motherboard has 7 PCI-E Slots!! This means as long as your power supply can support 7 miners, you can attach 7 GPU's to ONE motherboard.


## Best Groestlcoin Mining CPU

 Next up, is the CPU. CPU mining is a thing of the past, as GPU's are more powerful. However, a miner still needs a CPU to function. This is a miner slot we can afford to be cheap on! I would reccomend using the [Intel Celeron G3900](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FNew-Intel-Celeron-G3900-Skylake-Dual-Core-2-8-GHz-LGA-1151-65W-BX80662G3900%2F272983283845%3Fepid%3D2254421607%26hash%3Ditem3f8f125885%3Ag%3AJs0AAOSwiHpaMxK1){:target="_blank"}. 


## Best Groestlcoin Mining GPU's

 For your GPU, you will want something powerful. The more money you spend on a GPU, the more hashrate it will deliver. There is a direct correlation to Hashrate and coins mined. For those of you who are going big, without a doubt you should choose the [Radeon RX Vega 64 GB](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dvictony%2Bpcie%2Brisers%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1311.R1.TR6.TRC1.A0.H1.Xradeon%2Brx%2Bvega%2B64.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dradeon%2Brx%2Bvega%2B64%26_sacat%3D0). This card has a reported hash rate of 45 MH/S. 

 If you are not willing to shell out ~$1,500 for a top of line mining GPU, I would reccomend the XFX R9 295X2. This will run you about ~$600. Keep in mind you have 7 PCI-E slots, so a few of these can be purchased as they are the more budget option!

 If you want to go even more budget on your GPU miner, which in my opinion is the miner slot you shouldn't go cheap on, I would reccomend the AMD R9-280X. This will cost ~$180. Getting 7 of these to fill your PCI-E slots will cost you around $1500.


## Best Groestlcoin RAM and Hardrive

For RAM, I would go with [Ballistix Sport LT 8GB](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FBallistix-Sport-LT-8GB-2-x-4GB-288-Pin-DDR4-SDRAM-DDR4-2400-PC4-19200-Deskto%2F302186302490%3Fepid%3D11011375574%26hash%3Ditem465bb50c1a%3Ag%3AF5AAAOSw4QVZz728){:target="_blank"}


You'll want an SSD, I reccomend the [Kingston A400](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FKingston-A400-120GB-Internal-SATA-Solid-State-Drive-for-Laptops-and-Desktops%2F202062633818%3Fepid%3D2255075931%26hash%3Ditem2f0bdf1b5a%3Ag%3ADhIAAOSwnHZYkxhk){:target="_blank"}


## Best Groestlcoin Power Supply PSU

The Power Supply and the GPU are in my opinion the most important slot for any miner. Depending on how many cards you end up mining with, I would reccomend the [Corsair HX1000i](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.m570.l1311.R3.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xcorsair%2Bhx.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dcorsair%2Bhx1000i%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"}, or the [EVGA 1000 GQ PSU](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.m570.l1311.R4.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xevga%2B100.TRS0%26_nkw%3Devga%2B1000%2Bgq%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"}. The EVGA 1000 GQ is pretty much required if you decide to mine with over 3 GPU's.

## Best Groestlcoin Case

Cases, outside of wiring and cooling, are all cosmetic. I wouldn't know what case looks best to you, but I will show you one I like! Depending on how many GPU's you are using, this case may not work. A lot of times people make their own cases to fit the space they are mining in. The [Corsair Carbide Case](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dcorsair%2Bhx1000i%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xcorsair%2Bcarbide.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dcorsair%2Bcarbide%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"} provides style with a relatively low cost. Expect great airflow and spacing from this case.


## Best Groestlcoin Mining Operating System

The operating system for your miner doesn't matter a whole lot. [Windows 10](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dcorsair%2Bcarbide%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xwindows%2B10.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dwindows%2B10%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"} is my operating system of choice.


## Best Groestlcoin Mining Risers

I would reccomend this 6 pack of [VICTONY PCI-E Risers](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338053182&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3Dwindows%2B10%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xvictony%2Bpcie%2Briser.TRS0%26_nkw%3Dvictony%2Bpcie%2Brisers%26_sacat%3D0){:target="_blank"}.


## What is the Best Groestlcoin Mining Pool

The best Groestlcoin mining pool is without a doubt the [SuprNova Mining Pool](https://grs.suprnova.cc/index.php?page=login). It has 0% fees, how can you argue with that!

## Why Mine GroestlCoin?

I think Groestlcoin is a great coin to mine as their project is undervalued. They also are ASIC resitant, so you don't need a $3,000+ miner to compete. 


## What Program Should I Use to Mine Groestlcoin?

Download [CCMiner](http://ccminer.org/), it is the only miner I have experience with for Groestlcoin. Read an indepth guide [here:](https://www.reddit.com/r/groestlcoin/comments/78yzxe/how_to_mine_groestlcoin_step_by_step/)
