## BitPanda

We like [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=7989064235904733469){:target="_blank"} because they have many payment options and good, low fees. They are available to most of Europe, but not the US or Australia. They also have pretty much instant buys.

**Fees**: BitPanda does not list fees but you can do the math once you see the purchase price. 

**Limits**: Gold verified users can buy up to €350 worth of bitcoins per day, and up to €10,000 per month.

## LocalBitcoins 

There are sellers that will accept NETELLER for bitcoin on [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/neteller/?ch=fd49){:target="_blank"}. 

**Fees**: Fees vary by seller on LocalBitcoins 

**Limits**: No official limits since each seller can set their own limits. 

## What is Neteller?
