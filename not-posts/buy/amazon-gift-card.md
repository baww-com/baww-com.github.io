Buying bitcoins with an Amazon Gift Card Code is difficult. The two main reasons are: 
 
1. It's impossible to check the balance of Amazon Gift Card codes without depositing them to your account. 
2. In general it's difficult to buy bitcoins with any type of gift card. 

We really suggest buying bitcoin using another payment method, such as credit card, debit card, or cash. But if you really need to buy bitcoins with your Amazon gift card then there is really only one option: [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/amazon-gift-card-code/?ch=fd49){:target="_blank"}. 

LocalBitcoins is a decentralized exchange. Unfortunately, selling your code on LocalBitcoins will take some time. This is because LocalBitcoins does not buy the gift card directly from you, but instead helps you find someone in your area who wants to trade bitcoins for an Amazon gift card. 

If you live in a city this may work but if not that you are probably out of luck for buying with an Amazon gift card. 

Be careful of scams! 

[Give it a shot at LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/amazon-gift-card-code/?ch=fd49){:target="_blank"}! 

Good luck!
