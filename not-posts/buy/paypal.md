Buying bitcoin is hard. Buying bitcoin with PayPal in 2017 is even harder. But: 

It is possible! 

This easy, step-by-step guide is going to show you, pretty much, how to buy bitcoins with PayPal instantly. 

You'll have to follow these simple steps: 

1. Create an account on [VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} -- which stands for the Virtual World Exchange. 
2. Fund your newly created account with PayPal in USD or Euro. 
3. Trade your USD or Euro for SLL (another currency on VirWoX).
4. Once you have  SLL, you can trade SLL for bitcoin. 
5. Withdrawal your bitcoins!
