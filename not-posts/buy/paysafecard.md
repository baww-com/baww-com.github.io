Paysafecard is not a commonly requested payment method to buy bitcoins, but there are some people that want to. 

[VirWoX](https://www.virwox.com?r=22aa25){:target="_blank"} used to accept it for bitcoins but has temporarily disabled Paysafecard as a payment method. 

You can check back with them but at the time of writing VirWoX still has not re-enabled this payment method. 

For now you can try to find a local seller on [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/eur/paysafecard/?ch=fd49){:target="_blank"}.
