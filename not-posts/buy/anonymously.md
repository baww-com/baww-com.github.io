Most online exchanges require ID verificaiton. So if you want to buy Bitcoin anonymously with no ID then you will need to use one of the following options:

## LocalBitcoins

[LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/?ch=mj9n){:target="_blank"} allows sellers and buyers to meet up in person and exchange bitcoins for cash. You can also make cash deposits with LocalBitcoins but some sellers may require your ID. 

## Buying Bitcoin Anonymously

You could try to buy using [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwideio){:target="_blank"} as they require the least amount of information of most Bitcoin exchanges. Even if you buy bitcoins anonymously, in most cases you still owe taxes on your capital gains if you make a purchase. Check your country's tax laws for Bitcoin. 

## Coin ATM Radar

[Coin ATM Radar](https://coinatmradar.com/){:target="_blank"} is a Bitcoin ATM Index that will help you locate Bitcoin ATMs in your area. Most Bitcoin ATMs require no verification so they are anonymously and you can just insert cash and get bitcoins sent directly to your wallet. 

The one bad thing about ATMs is that they have high fees but that is the price people are willing to pay for extra privacy and convenience.
