Buying Bitcoin using a bank account is one of the most cost effective and efficient ways of buying large quantities of Bitcoins at a time. Listed Below are the best and most trusted used for buying Bitcoins. We will have picture and text walkthroughs to guide you through the process!

## Coinbase

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} is one of the most popular ways to buy bitcoin with your bank account in the USA, Europe, Canada, Singapore, and Australia. If you live in the US, you can add a Visa or Mastercard credit card as a backup to unlock instant payments via bank transfer. The fees for purchasing with your Bank Account are around 1.4%. For extremely small transaction amounts such as $10-$200 Coinbase charges a base fee around $1-$2. The base minimum fee starts to disappear around the $200 mark. After that it is the stated 1.4% fee. If you were to buy with a credit or debit card, you would pay more than double the fees! Alright, enough information, lets get buying.

## Step 1: [Create an Account](https://www.coinbase.com/join/53bc38a3b11f6623df000004){:target="_blank"} on Coinbase

To create an account on coinbase, you only need to enter your first and last name, email address, password, and State/Country. 

After entering the requested information, a confirmation email will be sent to your provided email. Click the link in the email to continue!

**Bonus Security Step:** Enable two factor authentication! If you would like to add an extra layer of security to your account, consider adding TFA. Anytime time someone (hopefully you) attempts to enter your account, they will be prompted with a code. This code can be retrieved by text, or an app called Authy. I reccomend Authy but both methods work!


## Step 2: Add a Payment Method and ID

In this scenario, we are buying using our Bank Account, so add that as your payment method. To do this, you can click the "Complete your Account" button on the middle left corner of the page. Another method is by going to the Buy/Sell Tab and adding your method there. Below are pictures showing what these sections look like.

Next, we need to add identification, Coinbase is required to ask for this by law. If you are interested in low identification requirement methods of obtaining Bitcoins, try [CoinMama](https://www.coinmama.com/?ref=buyaltcoinsworldwide){:target="_blank"} or [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/?ch=mj9n){:target="_blank"}.

Add your picture and wait for confirmation!

## Step 3: Buy Bitcoins!!!

Click the Buy/Sell tab and enter your desired amount. You can enter the amount of Bitcoin you want, or the amount of USD/EUR you are willing to spend. Both work the same! Coinbase has initial limits of $7500 weekly BTC purchases but these can be increased by buying BTC.
